Title: Best car ever!!
Review:  I bought this car from my sister about five years ago.Sometimes she indicates she would like it back.There is no way she is getting it because I am driving it until the wheels falls off. It has more than 120,000 miles on it.It needs some cosmetic repair.However I haven't had much more than routine repair such as tires, brakes and oil changes.It is too bad they do not make anymore.

Title: Great Car! Don't be afraid
Review:  Had this car for 8 yrs and had minimal problems. Repair shops will give you the run around if you don't know anything about cars. I can get practically any part for this at the local Autozone. If a mechanic won't touch it you need a new mechanic. He/she should be able to fix anything and it's not rocket since. This car has 4 wheels and an engine just like every other car on the road. Much easier to work on than a VW for sure. I had my doubts when my wife bought it in 2002 but it has been a great vehicle and at 10 years old it looks amazing, is dependable, and cost us practically nothing to own. Great car! Too bad Daewoo went under here.

Title: Disappointmnet
Review:  Bought this car as a commuter vehicle for a van pool.  I was very disappointed in the vehicle in comparison to a 1997 model I had previously.  The motor was sluggish and tended to have a rough idle.  The A/C was better than the old van, but still lacked a separate control for the front and back.  What I was most disappointed with was that in moving up five years, I lost driver room, the ability to adjust the steering wheel to where I like it, and the passenger seats, by all accounts were less comfortable.  What I noticed in driving is that the vehicle had a very large turning radius.  Very difficult to maneuver in traffic.

Title: Not what Dodge used to be
Review:  Good solid frame and suspension.  Well equipped, full power.  Gauges and controls are well designed and located.  Nice to drive once you are up and in.  No leg room on passenger side.  318 engine seems very weak and some spark plugs are very hard to access.  Terrible gas mileage (avg 12MPG).  Sheet metal is flimsy and dents if you lean against it or bump it.  Paint chips and scratches very easily.  Sliding side door jumped the track and scraped the whole side of the van.  Rear door caught in wind and pulled bolts out of frame.  Three front windshields in three years (stress point in center?).  No mechanical problems with drive train.  Reliable.  Still not the quality my older Dodge vans had.

Title: Failur is lurking in every corner
Review:  Purchased the vehicle in 2003 second hand with 15000 miles from the owner (a one driver operator, not rental). This review was written in 2017 with only 110000 miles on it! It has been a great service van for my business but not without flaws. After warranty expired problems begin. Had to replace computer controller few times. Fuel hose went bad, chair adjustment lever broke, minor repairs here and there, water pump replaced, temperature control unit replaced, gas tank and pump replaced. Using a very accurate repair expenses controlled by business analysis I can say that the average repair cost is around $600 per year. This vehicle can't go farther than 10 trips without me worrying when would be the next problem. Dealer sticker say 12/15 miles per gallon but with very conservative driving my records show 17 miles per gallon. Overall I don't think it's the best value for vehicle but being optimistic as I am it is not the worst either. Hope this helps.

Title: Great Van
Review:  Bought used with 34k,the conversion package by Elk automotive is top rate. Has leather, cd, dvd, rear air, tv, rear stereo, all the goodies. Very easy to drive despite its size, ride is nice and quiet inside. With the 318 engines and regular service these things are allmost bullet-proof. As most manufacturers produce very few of the large van conversions any more and the new ones costing 50k that are available, I feel that for 20k I stole this thing. One of the best things is it's still under warranty with Chryslers 7/70 plan. These are the only way to travel, if you are buying for everyday use, it's probably not the right vehicle.

Title: The beauty can mask anything
Review:   I am a mechanic, I bought my 2006 Dodge Magnum 3.5 High Output AWD a year ago with 54,600 miles on it. As always, I performed a full vehicle check on the car before purchasing it. I loved this car, it was fast fun, elegant, and provided everything I needed, at first. Since I bought it I have had numerous mechanical, programing, and electrical issues currently totaling to $4,500 dollars. Just to give an idea, at 70,000 miles my throttle just went out (this isn't included in what I have already spent) and I now have to replace the entire intake system which is going to cost around $2,200 (these costs don't include mechanics fees, which will potentially double the costs) *A battery cost $300

Review:  I drove a Dodge Charger last year and like the ride, so when it was time for a new car I went for the Magnum. I like to be able to load stuff the flea market and go fishing so I went with the wagon. It was like driving a SUV, and the speed!!! I had to check myself a few times, but this is the most powerful car I ever had. I drove a Nissan Altima for 2 years and this is a whole new class of car. Stylish, fast, a real head turner. It had over 80,000 miles, but you can't tell by the way it rides and excels on the road. So far so good, it seem to be a well build wagon with AWD for the snow, glad that I got this....

Review:  I had many problems with my Magnum RT. Wheels started to corrode, transmission leaked, windshield wiper controls had to be replaced (all fixed under warranty). Had to replace factory tires at 31,000 miles, replaced a tie-rod at about 40,000 miles, and the brake rotors warped. Wiper controls were again acting up, and a noise started in the front suspension when I finally decided to trade it off. Loved the power and looks, but it had to go. Build and component quality was awful. This car turned me off of Dodge products.

It's time for Toyota to stop relentlessly pursuing perfection. Because Dodge got there first with the magnum rt. The power is unbelievable. Handling outstanding. And comfort is second to none. I've been a mustang owner and lover for the past 15 years. But now, after driving this magnum hemi for less than a week, I'm in love with it. With 82k miles it feels as if it just rolled off the assembly line and into my garage. Simply amazing automobile.

Review:  Man, this thing is huge - at 4500 lbs it weighs as much my wife's mininvan! And, it drives like it, too - not exactly "agile." I would have never payed $35,000 for a new one, but for $13,000 w/65,000 miles I think it was a steal, and it's one of the coolest looking cars ever. Doesn't feel as fast as you might think it would, and gas mileage still not good even w/cylinder management. But, every time I look at it or smash the gas, it makes me smile. Oh, and it'll hold quite a bit of crap, too.

Title: 2006 SE 2.7
Review:  Love the style. Mine has color matched 22" chrome wheels...had a side wall puncture. Can't replace just one tire and had to go to several places to find a good tire in stock since I did not want to wait to order tires. Cost for 2 was pricey but that has nothing to do with the car. Also, to anyone thinking about beefing up the look with big tires and rims, okay for around town but you lose some of the quality in the ride. Have tried to figure out why but no one can give me an answer. Non the less, with the color coordinated rims (car is metallic red) it's an eye catcher. No mechanical problems. It's a 2006 SE 2.7 with 40,000. I wasn't looking to win a race and don't want a gas hog.

Title: Fun & quality
Review:  This is a very large car that handles like a sports car.  Corners flat, breaks straight, very comfortable ride and considering the too small engine, it has good acceleration.  It does NOT like to pull a trailer, but if you're reasonable it's okay with that too. The drivers seat is far too narrow, I'm a big guy and have to find just the right spot to get comfortable.  Some people don't like the sparten interior, but I like the design.  However, a little less of a plastic look would be nice.   The exterior design is outstanding and there are lots of storage pockets and nooks and crannies.  The standard tires are just adequate, but in Canada you really do need snow tires for winter safety.

Title: Awesome
Review:  I traded in my 3rd Yukon Denali 3 years ago for this car and I love it. I didn't need a big SUV, but I still needed the use of a utility vehicle for my business, kids and dogs. This car is great.  I average 20mpg with the 5.7 Hemi.  I can have my cake and eat it too.  I leased the car back in 2006 and just thought I would lease or buy another car when my time was up, but Chrysler sent me an offer I couldn't refuse. If I buy the car at the end of the lease, Chrysler will take a substantial amount off the residual buyout amount in the contract, so Iv'e decided to buy the car. 3 years and 57K miles later I haven't had any problems except with the navi which is a minor repair hopefully.

Title: One of the best cars I've ever had
Review:  I needed to replace my aging and worn out Volvo 850 wagon. We are a family of 5 including two teenagers, one who is 6 feet tall. I needed a roomy car, that actually had legroom in the rear seat for my son. Short of buying a limo the Dodge LX cars are one of the only ones that fit the bill. I also wanted power and safety in the way of front and side air bags, trac control etc, etc. This car has it all in spades. I set out to but the 6cyl SXT but couldn't pass up the R/T when it crossed my tracks. If you are sensible on the throttle the R/T's fuel mileage is almost as good as the 3.5 SXT. My advice is if you have a choice, buy the R/T with the 5.7, it's way more fun and still decent on fuel.

Title: What to expect at 80,000 miles
Review:  I bought my '06 SXT RWD used in Nov. '06 with 13k miles.  It now has nearly 81k miles.  Overall, it's been very reliable...roomy, comfortable, fast, no rattles, and decent gas mileage (22 mpg avg. in mixed highway and city gridlock). The RWD has only been a problem once, in a very heavy snow. The front brake rotors were replaced at 38k, and will need to be replaced again soon.  The original tires lasted to 71k. At approx. 75k, a rocker arm broke, a $500 fix.  The mechanic says it's common, but not frequent, on the 3.5 liter motor.  Other than that, just oil changes and tire rotation.  I love the styling of the car, too bad it's been discontinued.  Everyone who rides in it loves it!

Review:  The SE is fun to drive, has wonderful racy styling and handles like a dream.  It corners flat and holds the road beautifully.  The 2.7 Liter engine is a little underpowered for the size of the vehicle, but considering it is such a small engine, I have no problem with available power.  I purchased the 2.7 specifically because I wanted a vehicle that affords good fuel economy, and it delivers that plus I like driving the Magnum.  I purchased the car in 2008 and am very happy with the value received.  I get a car that looks and feels like a new car and the 2 years depreciation (60% off new price) give me a real bargain.  I don't understand it but like getting such a great bargain!

Title: Fun and flexible.
Review:  I went from a 2006 Honda Odyssey (3 steering racks in 20,000 miles was 3 too many) to the RT. The cargo volume is not quite that of the van but it is good. Four guys and golf bags are handled with ease. The gas mileage to date (5500 miles) is one mile to the gallon worse than the Honda. The fun to drive factor is approximately 8.5 out of 10. If you have to drive a wagon this is the one that will make you smile. I can only imagine how much fun the SRT8 must be to drive. I am already planning some tweaks to the engine and suspension because the chassis is just so good that it begs for more power and better spring rates. This really is a great platform, hats off to the engineers at Dodge

Even though I did not get the AWD, it still rocks in any weather, with the addition of Blizzaks for the winter. I'm 6'4" and it is really comfortable, plus with two car seats in the back, the kids have enough room too. I put the whole family in and we go looking fo twisty turny roads to play on.  With the autostick, I can run that car pretty hard and it just keeps asking for more.  Cruises really nicely for the 25 mile each way commute, but gotta keep an eye on it.

It could have been an instant muscle car but the 3.5 L V6 just didn't have it.I mean the 3.5 is a great motor just not the Horse power I wanted. So I bought a 2006 SRT8 w/ the 6.1 L Hemi. Wow! It's balck just like the one before and a whole lot faster. The power is almost unbelivable between the two. I miss the all leather seats and moon roof the SXT had. The 20" rims make for a little more bumpy ride but the handling is superior. Lots of power and good looks!It's what I wanted when I bought my first Magnum.

Review:  I have had a lot of performance cars in my life and this is one of the best. It is very useful as you can carry other people or use it to go to the hardware store. It is fast and fun to drive on top of that. It handles very good and rides really nice on the highway.  I had the RT before my SRT8 and both of these cars are real nice. It reminds me of my younger days in the 60's when a lot of people had "sleeper wagons." It runs with most cars on the street and yet gets great gas mileage.  425 HP and I am averaging between 19 and 21 MPG.  Depends on how many times you put your foot into it. How can you beat that?

Review:  I looked at many vehicles over 6 months before deciding on the Magnum. I have had it now for a 1 1/2 years and am very pleased. I have 4 kids and can fit them all in and still have space in the back. The car drives very well and has great brakes although I would recommend ABS. I got the 2.7L v6 for the gas mileage. It does not have alot of power but I do get 20 mpg in the city. I have not taken it on any long trips so I don't know the highway mpg. For around town the car is perfect, it looks great, handles well, gets good mpg, is very comfortable (I am 6'3) and can take 5 adults plus stuff in the back. We had a Dodge Polaris wagon growing up, there is no comparison!

Title: My Magnum Rocks!
Review:  I sell Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep products, and have been looking closely at the 300, Charger and Magnum for some time. Comparing all things equally, my Magnum fits my kids and their stuff (hockey, lacrosse, football and all other equipment), and my golf clubs and my hubby's. It has the hot looks of a sexy sportscar, but has the capability of a family sedan. I feel great driving this amazing vehicle, and working as a Sales and Leasing Consultant, I get to drive dozens and dozens of vehicles and models all the time! I love my leather interior, sunroof, autostick and Boston Acoustics stereo for when I want to crank it up!

Review:  All in all I will have to say this is my all time favorite car! Love the power! No more waiting to get out in traffic. Plenty of cargo space and seats are very comfy. The only downside is that it is so peppy that we can't seem to keep our foot off of the gas! We were sold from the test drive on this car. If you're going to get one, get the Hemi! It is well worth it!

Title: Top Notch
Review:  The Mercedes Benz based 4-matic is amazing. I will never drive another car without it. Wet weather traction like i have never seen before. All this on top of 340HP! Styling speaks for itself. Love it or hate it. Interior is huge. Turning radius is great for such a huge car. Speed, well there are cars that are faster but I dare them to do it in such a good looking car or loaded up with 5 people and groceries and still have power. Eat that import lovers. My only minor want is at $34k why could I not get the auto turning mirrors when the car is off like its German cousin. All together, I don't think you could get all the things this car offers from anyone else at the price its offered.

Title: 50000 and going
Review:  16 months and over 55,000 miles, what you have is the very good, and the very bad. First the good, power, space for my big frame 6'3", 280lbs, and lots of boxes. Nice, but not overwhelming interior, nav, heated seats, adjustable pedals, all the good stuff. Now the bad, horrible dealer service, makes me want to go back to Toyotas, and Hondas. Priced the 60,000 service one dealer wanted $850.00, another wanted $470.00. I've had a thumping noise in the right front since 21,000 miles, been to the dealer 4 times they can't find it.Serveral rattles, in the dash, and hatch. I will not buy another Dodge simply because of the dealer service.

Title: SRT-8 Automotive Art
Review:  I first saw the SRT-8 at the International car show when it was just a concept. At the time, I told my wife that if they build it I want it. I first test drove it July of 2006 and fell in love. I have been a GM person my whole life, but things were about to change. I have owned 24 cars from classic Impalas, Corvettes, Camaros and list goes on. I actually traded a 1996 Impala SS for the SRT-8. There is nothing bad at all to say about this car. Styling, comfort, and oh yeah, performance like you never had. I can carry my family of five around, or pick up a TV and still lay rubber like I was in a sports car. Cold air induction and a catback exhaust is now on order. Can never have too much power.

Title: Comfortable, great ride, nice handling
Review:  This is a company car for us.  The 2.7 liter engine provides merely adequate performance from a stop and at speed, and I'd recommend one of the larger engines.  The legroom is excellent for front and back passengers.  The headroom is very good.  The telescoping steering wheel is extremely helpful and complements the power driver's seat to find an ideal driving position relative to the fixed position pedals.  The ride is excellent.  Cornering feels solid and not as though it's a 4000 pound vehicle.  Rear cargo space is limited, unless folding the rear seats.  We've needed to use the optional roof rack during trips.  Coupled with a bigger engine, this is a very fun, comfortable car.

Title: What a machine!
Review:  While I have only put 1500 miles on this Hemi-powered rocket, I was impressed from the first moment of a test drive.  I was attracted to it by the syling and Hemi power.  I read a lot of reviews on the Magnum and researched every bit of material that I could find.  When I finally decided to buy it, I never regretted my decision.  This car handles like a sports car with the Mercedes suspension.  The car is bearly broken in so the only issue I have is with the city mileage.  The first tank was all local driving (NYC) and I got 12 mpg.  I have to be careful getting on the highway because you are up to 85 mph before you know it. Great stereo and plenty of room. People are impressed with this one.

Title: Excellent Utilitarian Vehicle
Review:  We have taken the car on two long road trips already.  I was worried about the small V6 in such a large car but the pep was sufficient for excellent highway driving.  The car is smooth and the steering is sharp for such a large car.  Although the small windows in the rear reduce visibility, the side mirrors are the first adequate mirrors I've ever seen on a car making the car much more navigatable through city streets. Fuel economy is actually exceeding the mid-size sedan we traded in.  The transmission is uncharacteristically smooth from my previous experiences with Dodge.  Only one minor warrenty issue so far (switch knob).

Review:  I have had my silver Magnum SE for almost 20 thousand miles and have not had a single issue.  I have never taken it back to the dealer for anything other than oil changes.  I have not encountered any of the problems that other people have posted on here.  It is super quiet and very solid.  Everything has worked perfectly!  I love the styling.  I get a ton of envious looks from both men and women, even with two carseats in the back.  It is the coolest "Dad" car on the road in my opinion.  It is very easy to load and unload kids and all their "equipment."  I feel very cocky on the road in this car and I don't even own the Hemi.  I live in El Paso and I have only seen a handful of others.

Review:  I had a 2004 Ford F-150 5.4L V8. I traded it in for the 2006 Magnum, and the two things that I was worried about was leg room and fuel economy. My truck was great with interior space, but with gas hitting $3.00 per gallon, and me having to drive over 100 round trip to work, I needed something better for fuel. I was a little put off on the Magnum, but the leg room sold me. There is almost as much leg room as my truck, and even though I get the same mileage on fuel, it cost me 1/2 has much to fill up.

I have definitely upgraded from my minivan and no longer feel like I've given up on life! :)  I definitely do not need a Hemi, but am a bit disappointed with the 2.7.

So everytime I saw one I said "honey look there is another one". It didn't take long for the Magnum to grow on her. She loves her new Magnum. I put a billet grill on it. The chrome pillers and back lights. Also the door handles and mirror are now chrome. We have the hottest Magnum in the Las Vegas area. Everyone in town that has a Magnum thinks ours is a custom Magnum. I won't tell them where I got my parts from. Let them do some work to make theirs maybe as nice as ours.

Review:  Only had a couple months, but I'm loving it so far.  Very fun to drive, and plenty of power.  Fuel economy just under the 17 MPG city.  But, this car needs the 8 cylinder, not the 6. I don't have the navigation, but the satellite radio, electronics group, sun roof and convenience group are great additions. This has more storage room in the back than our mini-van when both of the bench seats are in it.  I'm 6'2" and feel very comfortable in this. Takes a little bit of time to get use to the viewability out the windows, but with the small round mirrors added to the side view mirrors, you should do fine.  No regrets so far!

Title: Magnum RI
Review:  There is no better way to say this: I have never been happier with any car (and I've had quite a number of them) than I am with my Magnum SXT AWD.   I chose the 3.5L V-6 because 250 HP is a lot of power, no matter how you cut it.  The AWD keeps the wheels firmly planted.  I corner hard, and this thing hasn't even squealed the tires a bit. So far, I'm averaging 17.5-19.0 mpg, combined, and driving habits give you the predictable results in that area.  Style: this car has it in abundance. It rides like a dream, courtsey the chassis and tranny from the Mercedes E- class underneath.  Interior is beautiful, elegant, with a touch of attitude.  I've never been happier with any car, ever.

Title: Once was just not enough
Review:  Bought a new SRT Magnum for my own retirement gift in 2007. Simply loved it but eventually sold it to a friend's son who kept bugging me for it (for 3 years).  After that I owned 2 Chargers, 1 R/T, 1 SRT and a Chrysler 300C.  I really missed  the wagon because of the versatility and nasty looks so when I was able to find the second wagon I grabbed it. Never have had any issues with any of these vehicles but then I take care of all the maintenance/repair myself so no one can mess them up. There is a HUGE difference between the 5.7 and 6.1 Hemi LX cars pretty much in all respects so for me it will always be the SRT. The 6.1 responds very well to small changes (tuning,exhaust,CAI) and kicks real butt when you also loose 150-200 lbs of weight from the car which is not that hard to do. Even with the 12 sec. 1/4 mile performance I get around 23mpg on 75mph trips. Best of both worlds and the darn thing is a wagon to boot! Kudo's to the SRT team.  This gang has brought back the old day attitude and swagger we had in the 60's and early 70's. Chrysler leads and the others follow ( after complaining and trash talking about being beaten of course). Some things never change.

Only thing I can see is when trying to drive down long straight roads the long wheelbase and ten inch tread in the front  goes away from straight much easier than smaller tread tires but  it corners  unbelievable for a 4,300 lb. wagon with a long wheelbase, I'll take the cornering ability anytime.

Title: SRTGreat
Review:  I tracked the SRT8 Magnum since it was first shown and then in to production. Since my wife has a R/T Magnum, when I could get an SRT8 there was no hesitation. It is quick, I have out performed many much higher priced cars, walked away from a M5, X5 and other hi pro cars. The car is a natural street "looker" and is well liked by "car people". The Red Pearl color is perfect and reinforces the design and general performance stance. I think Dodge has a winner here and every day I drive it I like it more. No matter what my mood, it gets better when I fire up the 6.1 Hemi. The only thing I would change is to make the exhaust "growl" more at idle and normal low end driving.

As your heartbeat increases and your palms get moist, you accelerate from a complete stop, the G-forces press you into the seat and you smile as the speedometer eclipses the century mark in under 13 seconds. The highly bolstered seat holds you comfortably in place as you execute corners like you're glued to the road. This automobile is also practical because you can take along three passengers and their luggage with ease. I would recommend you at least test drive a SRT8 vehicle before you buy anything else!

The car itself is 100 times more beautiful that the Miata version. My sticking points were ABARTHs comming to US had FIAT badge on wheel. As of March 2018 that has changed. Abarths now have proper abarth badging on the interior for 2018 but you have to look around as there are many older versions on lots. Next sticking point was that Miata's got the Retractable Fastback and FIAT's did not. What is more Italian that the RF top. Looks like the 70's Targa tops. Fiat could have branded it a Targa and they would not have been able to keep them in stock. I know all my friends were hoping for this as well. UGH! So I bought the ARARTH in Black. Wow the color is so deep and rich in the sunlight. Pictures do not do this car justice. Must see in person. My ABARTH is a bit rough in 1st gear for a manual. Been driving manuals all my life. This one I stalled 4 times on way home from dealer. The car wants to go. Low RPMs the car lags a bit and begs you to let it breath. There are two essential tweaks that fix this. One the DV+ diverter valve allows more low end and solves some issues with the cheap plastic diverter valve that comes from the factory which is either open or closed.... No in between. This DV+ also helps prevent turbo flutter which is potentially damaging buy allowing flow the turbo air flow back though the valve as the turbo winds down between shifts. Much healthier.. Second as the high pressure through the lines can bring with it some oil, it is good to add an oil catch can on these cars to reduce the amount of oil that can get back to the throttle and multiair unit which can be damaging over time. These two changes do help the car become more bullet proof. The car shifts great and has power.. Much more than the miata which I drove several times in my search trying to decide whether to drop the Fiat and just get the targa I love and deal with the angular futurist look of the miata rather than classic Italian beauty. I got the loaded version. I suggest just getting it with all options. Bose system is awesome, Navigation is easy. While touch is disabled when the car is moving, it is easy to manage shifting and using the dial to change channels etc. so the Tech in the car is great. Was able to save all my Sirius Channel Favs on way home from dealer lot. ABARTH sounds great in either Sport of Normal. Noted the Sport mode dials up the performance a bit which did feel more responsive. Im about 5 foot 10 inches tall and hover around 200 pounds and I fit comfortably in the car. If someone is over 6 foot they may find it cramped. I love the gauges and Abarth logos on seats and steering. It gives the car uniqueness and people have no clue what the car is when they see it which Scorpion badges all over it. I was asked at a gas station if it was a Ferarri. Lol I wish. Car takes corners like a champ and those Brembo Brakes really work well. I know that squirrel thanks FAIT for its life. Convertible top is same as Miata and is sooo easy to put up or take down. Chrysler and many aftermarket sites are selling a lot of after market upgrades so this car is very good if you want to make it a track car. But.. I only bought the two items i spoke of earlier. Abarth already has limited slip diff, Front and rear anti sway bars, Front and rear strut tower braces, Brembo brakes, and a killer sounding exhaust etc.. so its more performance than most people need. Im getting around 30 MPG average which totally surprised me. In summary, this car is more than I could have hoped for. I would like to see an aftermarket company make a targa top for this car but outside of that. Its my childhood dream of owning that Triumph TR7 or Fiat X 1/9 Bertone Targa car that I could never find married to modern day conveniences. I want to slap myself for even considering buying that Miata. I would have never forgiven myself. :) I am living my childhood dream of owning and driving a EURO roadster even if it is a Miata in Drag.

Review:  Don't buy one, one day after purchasing the car it broke down, I got stranded in the desert for three days, it cost me thousands of dollars to transport the vehicle, and now I can't find anyone to fix it.

Title: DREAM CAR
Review:  I bought mine 4/17 with 98K. Have been wanting a V6 5-sp, '05-'09 vintage for years. The engine is fine. Sounds good. Great mileage. Good power. I pride myself on smooth take-off and gear changes, but this is the orneriest transmission I've ever used! The difference between idle and 4000 rpm is about 1/8" on the gas pedal, so starting-out without either stalling or way over-revving takes a LOT of finesse. Gear changes are very difficult to master smoothly without lurching. The ride is very harsh with a lot of road noise, which I suppose goes with a quasi high-performance car. My '01 S-10 is quieter and smoother. All that said, it's a smokin' hot looking car, and still fun to drive. This was the first-off of the modern 'Stangs. Hopefully these problems have been ironed-out since.

Title: Get Rid of it before 100K
Review:  I drive 50 miles each way to work and traded my 01 accord for a 06 mustand in 2008. Well 80k miles later the engine starts having this knocking noise and significant loss of power and not because I don't take care of my car as I changed my oil every 3K miles and keep it very well maintained. After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver. Long story short before you buy research cam phasers this appears to be an issue in many Ford

Title: Get this car.
Review:  This car is just awesome.  The 4.6L V8 makes the car, and the stock exhaust has a nice rumble to it that screams when you mash the pedal to the floor.  I've had the car for 2 years and have about 52,000 miles on her with zero problems.  For the price, you really can't beat it either (16300 in 2009 with 33k miles). Its faster, better looking, and really just more of a car than any used BMW/mercedes within its pricing segment.  The only comparable competitor in the used car market this years Mustang has is in the 350z, which handles better but lacks in practicality.  And on top of that, the Z doesn't sound as good as the 8 and after test driving could be a nightmare as a daily driver

Compared to my 2 previous '73 Mach I joys, this Steed is more stealthy, has greater visibility and obviously more technologically refined. Had only one real issue with her.  The trip meter occasionally zero's itself even after extensive dealer repairs and tech help from Ford. Yes a few rattles. Also needed a new battery due to Florida heat. Got a set of General Ulimax HP tires and they are the best I ever owned. I'm not sure which I like better, watching my wife drive off in her, me driving us, or just looking at her.  Max Lives!

Haven't had any real issues, and have kept up with scheduled maintenance.  I did have a transmission pan leak which was repaired by a dealer; a few months later it was leaking again and the dealer fixed it again (free as was still under warr. then).  I have an extended warranty for peace of mind but don't anticipate needing it.  There has always been a little squeak near the gauge cluster, which I meant to get fixed but it hasn't bothered me enough to do so.

Review:  I was exceptionally impressed with the down and dirty V6.  The Chevy Monte Carlo LT and SS Intimidator have nothing on the 4.0 stock!! I bought an 06 5-speed Pony Edition before I went to college.  It's about 8 months later and the throttle body is havin issues, killing the car about every 30 miles.  The clutch is slipping already, not impressed with that.  The Shaker 500 is really nice, don't crank it too loud though.  The amp for the stereo runs down the factory battery like no other.  It's reliable as heck until the engine starts acting up.  Had the system checked, so I know its the throttle body.  For a car that is four years old, the clutch and induction should not be having trouble.

Review:  09/23/06 I financed a '06 Mustang GT, my 1st new car. Previously my family and I have had about 10 Fords. after 6 mos. the car stalled out, I didnt think anything of it. In'07 the problem became more noticeable I also had the battery replace twice. The alternator and L/F headlight (water). In'08 the problem became more frequent stalling between 30-40mph. The dealer couldnt find thr problem after frequent visits. In Feb.'09 I was going to trade it in for a used '08 Shelby GT500. The deal fell apart when the belt kept tearing. Took it to another dealer and was told crank was bad, waited 2 mos. to have engine rebuilt. called cust.service they're very nasty. Lemon law,govt agencies,legal no help

Nothing else was cooler.  Then Ford released the '05 model, now that's a Mustang! Well in a nutshell I found a tungsten grey '06 GT auto with 7k on it and bought it. Best decision ever. I love this V8! It's fast and it sounds great, though mine now sports a cold air intake and Pypes Violator exhaust and it turns heads with it's loud rumble.  Also this car is built extremely well. 31k on it and not even a rattle, not a problem. This is one I WILL NOT BE TRADING IN!

Review:  I have been very pleased for the most part with my 06 Mustang GT.  I think the retro styling of the car is great.  It's like driving a 60s Mustang only better.   The steering response is great and it corners like a dream.  I am 6'2 and have never had a car that felt this comfortable. The Shaker 500 sounds awesome.  I have had aftermarket setups that didn't sound as good.  I only have a couple complaints. The rubber strips used to seal the inside of the windows scratch the hell out of my window tint when running them up and down.  There is a rattling noise under hard acceleration that almost sounds like detonation; but I am running 92 octane fuel and have ruled that out.   Very impressed

Review:  First the bad.  Struggling to get a full tank is unacceptable.  Turning the nozzle upside down usually fixs the problem.  Car is kinda thirsty but for the performance you get on regular gas, it's within the bounds of acceptable. I have an automatic and the hesitation on downshifting is unacceptable and unsafe when driving aggressively. Now the good. In over 39000 miles, it's never left me stranded.  Never been in the shop for repairs. Cabin is squeak and rattle free still.  Took it on a 8000mi trip and NEVER got out of it with a back ache.  Stereo is great. Seat, console and door armrest position is the best I've ever had.  I love the car and I'm not an easy person to please.  Worth a look!

Review:  Car is fun enough to drive, but having had the battery die twice in my garage, first time after owning it for two weeks, and again in June 09.  Auto feature on windows most times work fine, but often only work one way and not always the same way.  Air conditioning is poor most of the time.  Didn't work at all once, took it to the dealership- told it takes time to cool off - I guess an hour is not long enough when it's blowing hot air.  Next day it worked fine.  Wouldn't take it on a trip in hot weather.  Would not buy one again. Dealership charged me for an auto emission test, but not necessary if driven under 5000 miles in a year.

The sleek exterior reminiscent of the fastback look and retro interior are much preferred to the builds in the first half of the 2000's. My model is a torch red 5 speed manual which shifts much smoother than the previous vehicles. Options include all the V6 premium additions plus Pony Package (fog lamps / upgraded grill are sporty). The interior has a limited dark charcoal all leather finish, and the dash is upgraded to include the multi-function display below the speedometer and SHAKER-1000 Audio - much improved over previous MACH systems

Review:  My 2006 Mustang GT is my seventh Mustang and by far, the best. The car runs 13's in the quarter, gets over 20mpg, sounds great, and is a blast to drive. Not the best handling car on the road, not the fastest either, but a solid platform that you can make into whatever kind of Mustang you would like. Tons of after market support including: wheels and tires, body kits, suspension system upgrades, power upgrades like blowers, turbos, nitrous oxide injection, super chargers cams, heads, etc...  You take care of your Mustang and she'll take care of you. I run premium fuel and full synthetic oil. Follow the maintenance guidelines, don't be cheap and skip over expensive services.

Title: Have your cake and eat it too!
Review:  We ordered our's Labor Day of '05 and picked it up in Nov. Power, handling, MPG, looks are all amazing. At first, the MPG was awful but it's only temporary. After the break in period, I've seen as high as 26 MPG (at avg. 77 MPH) and regularly get 23-24 MPG on my commute (1/3 city 2/3rds Hwy). I suspect, it could go as high as 30 MPG on a long trip and a moderate 65mph but don't think I never put my foot in it. Plenty have tried but no one has beat me in stop light drags. Handling is surprising for solid rear axle, but would prefer a proper independent rear suspension. There are downsides, heavy doors, squeaks & rattles from dash but this is one of the most pleasurable cars on the road!

I have owned it for a year and am done putting time and money into it. Though you can customize the car to any extent your better off getting a Dodge, Toyota, anything other than a ford.

Title: Good Buy
Review:  I'll be sad to see mine go. I've had BMW's, Camaro's, and Vettes, and this is by far my favorite car to date. Very reliable so far with only one problem (fuel gauge sensor) but otherwise a perfect all around car.  Not too fast (yes there is such a thing), but more than fast enough to get you in trouble on any road.

Title: Sad but True....not worth it
Review:  I have owned my car for 3 years. Wanted one since I was a kid. Very unhappy. Squeaks and rattles in the dash, window tint scratches when rolled down, spoiler comes lose constantly, vibration in front end that no one can seem to fix, new rattle in suspension, beginning to have trouble with the drive train, carpet and leather wear terribly, windows are beginning to leak when washed, more wind noise etc. This car was garage kept and babied, there is no excuse for this horrible quality. Though it was fun to drive and gets lots of look I will likely never buy Ford again! Go with the Honda, Toyota, Acura, Lexus or what ever else you are looking at!

Title: Bought it new, falling apart
Review:  The 2006 Mustang v6 Coupe is my 7th Mustang, I bought it new off the lot, and it's left me stranded all over town--thank God I have roadside assistance!  After two years of ownership a dead battery left me stranded out at work at midnight, in March I'll have had the car 3 years and I just had to put a new transmission in it at 68,000 miles. The Ford dealer said that since I hadn't had the transmission serviced at 30,000 mile intervals like the manual says I need to, they can't help. I've not had the oil changed exactly every 3,000 miles, does this mean the engine is going to blow?  Very poor quality.

Title: Elvira
Review:  As soon as I got a glimpse of the 2006 Mustang GT I knew that I would have one, all I had to do was find one that was black on black. Well, that proved to be harder than anticipated. It took more than a year but we found a dealership that would allow us to build the car of our dreams. I picked Elvira up on Oct 2nd 2005 and she has been loved every day since. We drove her from Ohio to Florida in pouring rain without any trouble and surprising gas mileage. She is garage kept and stored as soon as snow threatens to fall. Our only complaint has been the cupholder position and trouble finding quality after market parts such as the shaker system that my husband suprised me with this past birthday

Title: The Best Mustang Yet
Review:  I have owned many Mustangs. From a 1965 Coupe to a 2003 Mach 1 (I still own that one). This is the best Mustang yet in every area. It handles well, looks great, and has much more room that any previous Mustang. I have a five speed manual and it gets over 30 mpg on the highway although it is not rated that high. This car is the best "all around" car I have ever owned. In addition everywhere I go everyone compliments me on the car and wants to know all about it.  I have found that not only is this car welcome at Mustang shows it is also welcome at all local cruise in's, car shows, etc. Try that with your SUV.  It is 1965 all over again with this latest generation Mustang!

Title: Great Mustang!
Review:  I've had my 06 Mustang GT for two and a half years. Overall, I love this car! The modern-retro look, the powerful v-8, the American-muscle rumble, its got it all. I always love driving it, even in my routine communites. In the world full of soccer mom mini-vans, clunky pick-up trucks, and ho-hum sedans, it feels good driving a car that stands out and demands attention. This just doesn't become a "daily driver car" like your grand am, accord, or malibu. This car becomes a part of you. You'll eventually end up giving this car a name like Shelby, Sally, or Eleanor. This is the type of car that you pass down to your children. So, buy one, throw in your fav AC/DC album, and drive and live!

Review:  I wanted a lime 68 as a kid but never could afford one. Now I am 50 and Ford not only brought back the color, but they made it look like what I wanted. I had been looking for a 68 or 69 in that color, which is impossible to find so I saw this 06 on the internet at my local dealer. One test drive made me realize that I didnt want an old one anymore. I got the looks coupled with power handling and a quality in the build that the 68 and 69 were lacking. So far I can't say enough good things about the car and hope to get a grabber orange to add to  the 89 convertible, 98 coupe and 06 GT that I have now.

Title: Great car, and holds up well
Review:  I've owned it for about 2 1/2 years now, I have about 45,000 miles on it. This was my first car, first manual. The clutch has been slipping for the past 10,000 miles or so (but held up well in my opinion). The handle/knob broke off of the driver seat release to lift it forward in order to get to the back seat. The rear differential has the TSB whining noise during low speed turns. And I also had a problem a few times with the TSB of water leaking into the passenger floorboard and causing some electrical problems. Overall, it's held up very well considering the abuse it's received. The seats are uncomfortable on a 2 1/2+ hour drive. The gas mileage is bearable, and not bad for the performance

I installed the dual exhaust, cold air intake, and a reprogrammer. This pony bucks now! It also rides like a dream. The fuel mileage is great on the highway, not so much in town. But that's my fault.

Title: Best bang for your buck!
Review:  This is my third Mustang, my last being an '88 GT convertible that I also bought new.  What a difference 18 years can make!  This car is faster, smoother, quieter (yes, I know a convertible is noisier, I'm comparing to friends' '88 GT hatchback), quicker around the corners, stops better, sounds better and gets better gas mileage to boot.  What's not to love?  This car was love at first sight.  I sold two cars to swing the downpayment and special ordered the car with all the toys - 18" wheels, and a 1000 watt 6 disc with subwoofers in the trunk.  I'm a stick shift guy and this car has a wonderfully smooth transmission that shifts much better than my '88 GT.  I commute 55 mi./day and get 22mpg

Title: A Great Pony
Review:  I bought mine new in July of 06. v6  Legend Lime w/pony package. I went with the V6 due to price and insurance cost. After adding a S&B CAI, Predator tune, and GT muffler, I bumped up the hp to that of a small block v8, about 240hp.  A 4:10 is going in shortly to makeup for the automatic. The v6 is a great platform to start off on if your on a tight budget. Responds well to S/C's which take the v6 to the 310hp range. I don't have that many miles on the car, but I haven't had any issues with it. I still get many compliments from people when I am out and about. I have no regrets with this car. It's a blast.

Title: Nice Pony
Review:  Options on our car include the Pony package, leather seats and upgraded stereo. Having owned a '65 Mustang Fastback for many years I really wasn't expecting to be impressed by the new Mustangs. Boy was I wrong. With each session behind the wheel of the new Pony, the poor handling, braking and lack of air conditioning of my classic Pony becomes even more evident. The new Pony really is more fun to drive. Even though I bought the car for my daughter, I do get to drive it when it needs gas. Which isn't that often since the peppy V6 gets 18-20mpg in town & 26-30 mpg on the road. So many styling cues taken from the early Mustangs I feel right at home in this car.

Title: Just Good
Review:  The car is a great commuter car. Not really a quick car (0-60mph 7-7.3 sec) from my experience (I have an auto). The tires are loud on the freeway and can get annoying on long trips.  The ride comfort on the freeway is good, but a litle stiff on city roads. Also there is a lot of body roll while cornering at over 18 mph. The transmission shifts nice and smooth, but it is not the quickest shifting transmission. The fuel economy is not bad in the city I get 18-20 mpg, but if I use cruise control on the freeway I average 24-28 mpg.

Review:  I waited to buy a Mustang after I saw that a new boby style was coming out.  I ordered mine from my brother who is a manager at a Ford dealer. Over the phone I showed him several web sites that had the type of spoiler, stripes and front air dam that I wanted. I grew up with sixties muscle cars and wanted mine to look retro. So many people stopped me to ask about the car that it began to get embarassing. The car look great. Dark Blue with white LeMans stripes, and a duck tail spoiler. My neighbor(its been across the street for 2 yrs)asked my wife what kind of milage I was getting with that old muscle car. She told him 20+ combined city/Hwy. he called her a lier,and she told him it was an 06.

I would highly recomend them. I can say I get looks from everyone when I drive by. The fuel milege is pretty good for a V8 with 300HP. The Shaker 500 stereo is very good for being stock. The only thing that I would like to see is a more race inspired bucket seat in the front. Other than that wouldn't change a thing.

Title: #1 Car to drive
Review:  I loved my 2003 Mustang GT deluxe coupe, but all it took was a short test drive for me to trade it in for a 2006 GT premium coupe (both manual transmissions). The increase in horsepower and safety was what truely convinced me.  I mostly do in town driving and average about 20 mpg, but I took two trips both over 1200 miles where I averaged 26 mpg.  I had to have the stereo replaced about 4 months after I got it, but since then I have had no problems.  I have a friend who owns a V6 and he didn't think that there was much difference between his and mine until he took it for a quick spin in the parking lot, now he is thinking of trading his in.

Acceleration and cruising at high speeds definitely are strongest points. Love the exterior and interior styling. I get lots of compliments. Older style Mustang drivers strike up conversations. Little kids come up to me. College dudes and teens in small Japanese sporty cars often want to race. Trunk space sufficent. Compared 350z and rx-8 when looking. 350z was not dailly commute friendly, RX-8 too small. nothing compares with the brawn and muscle of a mustang right now. Only negative is handling in rain and snow.

Hood insulation started burning at 2,500, fixed. Trunk popped on its own, fixed after 3 dealer visits. No start or die at idle, dealer cant find a problem. Mustang stripes below doors bubbled up, not fixed! Two weeks ago my car totally died, after fighting with Corporte Ford a week they let the dealer look at it, ignition coil pack fell off, yeah fell off, how in the hell!

Title: "Payback Pony"
Review:  While in hospital for 4 months, I used the latest style Mustang as my "carrot to recovery." My 1st "pinned in the seat" experience was in a '68 428 (I was 9). V6 goes like a small V8. In Canada, Ford markets this as the "Pony Pkg," which includes the handling pkg (ABS, traction control, and rear sway bar). Beautiful "Bullitt" wheels (17") and Pirrelli's, are included, along with Pony badging. 5 speed auto is smooth and saves gas (22 mpg imp). Build quality rivals my Camry. The vented, 4 wheel disc brakes are amazing! Car really handles well, too. Overall, I'm very pleased, with this well balanced car. The 210 horsepower V6 is ample for today's economy/gas prices/speed limits.

Title: Wild Stang
Review:  I purchased my 2006 GT convertible used from a dealer. It was 11 years old with only 22,800 miles on it. I had to see it to believe it. It was so beautiful.   Black  with red leather interior. I purchased the vehicle on site after a test drive of course. This is my 4th mustang and my third convertible. I am addicted to the mustangs. This model does remind me of my 1969 Grande  coupe I had. The lumbar support is a definite improvement for the lower back on this 2006 GT premium. This was a problem in my previous mustangs for longer trips over an hour or so. The pick up in acceleration is fantastic. I agree Ford should cut back on the plastics in the interior because it cheapens the vehicle.  I have a shaker 1000 system and it sounds really good. The cd player is garbage. The first cd I placed in it got stuck. I get plenty of looks and compliments all the time on her. This is a good cruiser car and the family and I enjoy the ride tremendously. Top down rolling down the highway is so soothing and therapeutic. I had a 2002 convertible and 2004 convertible and using the convertible top is a breeze on these newer models than the previous models. The top seems to completely fall into place without effort and you just lock it down with the lighter handles. I would have been great to have power passenger seat. I believe the passenger seat is too low and should have a power package or at least a manual lever to raise the seat or lower the seat and give lumbar support. The rear seats seem comfortable enough.  For a convertible, it is roomier than the Mercedes, jaguar and camaro.  The camaro does not compare. If you really look around, you can see more variations of mustangs by mustang owners than camaros. If you have a mustang, you can almost totally redesign the mustang to your personal needs with all the parts and accessories the  market have available for mustangs.  These have been very reliable. The previous fox body styles, 1999 - 2004 did have this seal leak between the transmission and engine that was annoying after about 90,000 miles and it was not a cheap fix. I am praying these new mach 1 body styles do not such flaws.  I have noticed though, the a/c in my older models got colder quicker was much colder. I saw a comment to the opposite so I am not sure why this is. I have had an 02 and 04 and you could freeze to death in there with the a/c on max. I did notice after running on the highway for a while, the car would stall if I got off the exit, stopped and then tried to take off again. I am not sure why this model does that. Over all, good price for a fun and reliable vehicle.

Review:  Bought the car with 9,000 km and 11 months old. The car has 90,000 km as of May 2010. The car has been bullet proof in terms of reliability. I have just replaced the tires and the original battery. The only issues have been: Engine check light on briefly at 87K, and self-cleared (must have been a loose gas filler cap), and the rear tail light bulbs blow every 15K or so ($4 bulb-big deal). Other than that: just oil and filter changes. Car has been very reliable and solid. Body creaks/groans at 90K are still minimal, but you can now tell the car is nearly 4 years old, lots of life left in it. I will replace shocks & struts this year and this should solve the problem.

Review:  I bought this car used with 17,000 miles and it was in perfect condition. The acceleration is decent but could always use more power. Handling has been excellent even in the 3 blizzards we've had this year. You do get bounced around quite a bit on bumpy roads but then again, it's not exactly a luxury car. My Color back-lighting is a cool feature to play around with. Insurance surprisingly wasn't that bad (considering I live in NJ). All in all this car has been amazing to own and a blast to drive considering it's a 110 HP improvement over my previous car.

I bought my gt because I got a good deal, and because I've always wanted a v8 mustang. Acceleration is awesome, you can hear this thing breathe. Handles well also. Takes corners like its on rails. Interior is ok, not as bad as some say, well to my standards. Leather is great, convertable top is awesome. Mpg is not that bad for me. I get around 18 city, and 26 on highway, I have a heavy foot too. Love the retro style... Don't regret purchasing this beast. Wish I had more power, but I can fix that with aftermarket stuff.

Title: Great retro fun, but...
Review:  Bought this car after convincing my wife we "needed" a convertible. Since we have a child, we needed something with a back seat. Since I needed a "sports" car (re: not FWD), the Mustang was the only real option. After years of disliking Mustangs (Fox platform versions), and driving several Japanese cars (Civics, WRX, etc), I was pleasantly surprised how quickly this car reminded me what's important in a car...a good sounding and performing engine, great looks, and back-to-basics simplicity, which means living with some shortcomings. The rear live axle can feel a little unplanted on rough roads during spirited cornering. The interior materials quality is also low-rent in look and feel.

Title: Not like the "Good Old Days"... better!
Review:  I've just turned 30,000 miles and have enjoyed each one of them. No reliability issues. Have only seen the dealer for routine service. This car is my daily-driver, rain, shine or snow. It has never failed to get me home, even in the snow! I've added a strut tower brace and a more-efficient (louder) exhaust. The exhaust seems to have helped the gas-mileage (avg 21- 22mpg mixed city/freeway). It is a comfortable car to take a trip in and the 500 watt stereo is fine. No squeaks or rattles.

Title: Always gives me a smile
Review:  When the new design Mustang came out in 05  I just loved the looks. Well, I decided to build one just the way I wanted, and ordered an 06 GT convertible with every option except the auto trans (how dare you !?) and the 1000 watt stereo (I wanted as much truck space as possible).  Well, I love it. The build quality is great. The performance is exhilarating. And it is always fun, fun, fun. A few issues were taken care of by the dealer - he bent over backwards to them make right.  The car just works.  And looks great doing it.  Im even surprised about how well the resale value has kept up.

Title: It sure ain't like my 1993 Mustang 
Review:  Where do I start, I bought this car with 14,000 miles. In feb 07 a month later I had it back to the dealer for the paint coming off the bumper. Got that fixed 2 weeks later, my school books where soaking wet I left my bookbag in the trunk. I thought the top was leaking, but after 8 trips to dealer with the car being there for as many 30 days to get it back with same each time we cant find the major leak. I have come to the conculsion that it is leaking from the weld in the body. Back to body problems the Mustang stripe has come off 2 times. I finally got tired of the dealer being so blind to the problem. I called a lemon law lawyer, so now I have a pending lawsuite against Ford. For all my trouble

Title: 2006 GT Convertable
Review:  We purchased this car one year old, and it has been fantastic in reliability and retro style. Love the convertable roof, stereo is very good (shaker 500), and the car drives extremely well. We traded a very unreliable and quirky Mazda rx8 for this car, and every time I turn the key the Mustang jumps to life and is eager to run. The car handles very well considering its size and gives the driver a confident feel of the road, always in control. A 1500 mile trip to the coast turned in 26 mpg which is great considering the HP/Size (way better than the RX8 too). In town average is around 18 mpg.

Title: Buy It--New or Used (2005 or after)
Review:  I just bought a 2006 GT Conv with 13000 miles.  I've had it two days and already love it.  My other vehicle is a Mazda CX-9 (for the family).  This one is fun for me and I can still haul the family for fun trips.  With the GT (V8), I'm surprised that I'm averaging 20-23 mpg--not bad considering the 300 horses and irresitible urge to nail it and nail it and well you get the point.  Buy this vehicle.  If $ are tight, I recommend an 06 or 07--great bargains out there.  I personally chose a used GT instead of a new V6.  I would have considered a used 05, but I never get a car its first year in production--no idea if there's any real basis in that- -just my personal hangup.

Title: Why did I wait so long to buy?
Review:  After searching all the competitors out there, including the German and Japanse cars, how could anyone not consider a Mustang? I bought a GT convertible. Wow, for the money this car has no peer. Right out of the box the power and handling of this car are fantastic. To think I can get add-on accessories to boost this performance to even higher levels without breaking the bank is even better. Top down driving is fun. Your passengers in the back may ask you to roll up the windows on the freeway, but in the front seats the wind is manageable. The family loves the car and want to take it everywhere. Four seats. Great stereo with excellent bass response. Very comfortable seats (I'm over 6') too.

I've had about a dozen cars (and even a few trucks) revving engines and wanting to race. Also had lots of comments on the "nice ride", one fellow with a PT cruiser convertable even made an offer to buy it at a stop light!  I had a 77 Cobra back when, and I have to admit you really can go back with this car.  If you want to have fun, you can't really go wrong with this ride.

Solid as a rock.  Fast, and the sweetest engine rumble.  Handles exceptionally well, and goes almost as quick as my supercharged 01 Jag XKR.  Rougher, more raw power, but it adds to fun.  Amazingly solid for a conv.   A truly fantastic value with auto, premium everything, etc.  Great car.  Tempts me to get rid of my Jag and match this conv with an 08 fully loaded GT coupe!

Title: Mid-life fantasy
Review:  I bought a convertible before I got too old to appreciate it, and I'm glad I did. My grandkids complain I'm too old to be driving such a hot car. Car is an absolute blast to drive, head and shoulders better than my 2000 GT coupe. Car looks super with top down, and I frequently get compliments. Power top has been trouble-free, no leaks to date. Biggest issue I have is interior squeaks/rattles I never had with my 2000 GT, which are annoying when top is up. Shaker 500 stereo is nice but I'm not sure speakers are suited to it. Rear defrost switch is in awkward position, hard to operate/see when in 5th gear. Using cupholders can make shifting awkward. Still, a tremendous value, super to drive.

I drove it to Florida in late November with plans to stop halfway for the night. But the car was so much fun to drive that I kept going. Twenty hours later I reached my destination and still wanted to keep driving.  Of the 51 vehicles that have passed through my hands in the last thirty-five years, this is the most enjoyable.  Note: With only 8300 miles, and being stored during the winter, I cannot truthfully report on longer-term reliability.

The old cars, especially with the prices they are currently demanding, don't have anything on this car. The ride, handling and performance are awesome and I wouldn't even think twice before making a cross country trip with this car. Unfortunately I live in the great white north so my baby is put away for the winter.

Review:  I am a Ford/Lincoln Mercury Tech for 38 years. I have owned three Lincoln Mercury MK-VIII 's and compared to this Mustang, Ford missed the mark . The handling is not near as good compared to the MK-VIII. I have taken curves on a every day basis at high speeds and the Mustang will feel loose in the rear end. This is due to the live axle. The Mustang is a fun car and quick, but would have better handling with an independent suspension. But all in all this is a very fun car to drive for a 58 year old young man. Note - the Mustang will pass just about everything except a GAS STATION.

Handles like a sports car should, road hugging smooth that pulls threw any curve. Power is more than enough, there may be faster, but I don't see people breaking their necks to look at the grandma styled competitors. Going top down is an experience everyone should have.

Review:  For what is really an inexpensive car, I have had more fun driving daily than any other vehicle I have ever owned.  The level of performance that is available right off the showroom floor for $30k cannot even be contemplated by any other car.  Throw in the fact that Ford understands and embraces the aftermarket phenomenon for Mustangs, and that the car is built for add-ons, and it can be a fun hobby.  Spend an extra $10k in upgrades and you have a car that challenges Porches, and blows away Corvettes.  Great job on this one Ford, now work on the rest of your line.

I like the fact that the V6 exhaust has a pleasant sound although I'm told switching to the right side GT muffler will improve the sound. Won't sound like a V8 but a more throaty sound none the less.

The automatic transmission in this car is the best shifting overdrive Ford transmission yet. It accelerates and shifts very fast for a stock car yet is smooth when driving normally. The power top is quiet and goes up and down quickly. The controls are laid out well and everything is within the drivers reach. The stereo is the Shaker and sounds okay (speaker placement is difficult in a convertible) but could be improved with the upgrade to the 1000. The fit and finish is the best I've seen from Ford.

I wanted a GT, but the loaded pony/premium with 500 watt stereo  with the v6 was great-especially since a GT this loaded was many thousands more, and beyond my budget.  I love this car and have rarely put the top up in the almost 3 weeks I have owned it. Funny how the CD's sound so much better!  How does one go through life without driving a convertible?  Having had classic cars in the past, I wanted something that would last, and have excellent parts AND service availably wherever I want to travel.

Title: Best Stang yet
Review:  Best Mustang ever. I love the styling even better than the Shelby GT500. Handling, ride and acceleration is outstanding. Interior is easy to maintain, comfortable and fits the character of the car. It avoids the "Tokyo by Night" over abundance of electronic doo-dads that distract from a true driver's car.

Review:  I picked this car in October of 05 after waiting 4.5 months for delivery. It was worth the wait. Ford hit not just a home run but a grand slam. Exceptionally powerful and comfortable cruiser. The world seems a better place when you are cruising in this future collectible with the top down. All of 65-69 Mustang styling cues in one package!

Title: Absolutely A Fun Car...
Review:  Always wanted a little pony, and what I got was one with a lot of power and a pretty smooth ride for a sports car.  It is the most fun to drive and it is definitely a head turner with its top down.  I have had more compliments on this car than i had during my 35 years of driving!  I've had the car about a month now and I find it very comfortable inside and easy to drive. The stereo is super. I love the idea of the changing interior colors on the dash as well as the other features you would expect in a luxury car. The exterior is awesome. I have yet to take it on a long trip to see the gas mileage highway driving. I recommend this car to anyone looking for a sports car.

Title: Not Your Father's Mustang!
Review:  While vacationing in South Beach (Miami), my wife and I rented a convertible. We liked it so much we decided to buy one. But let me tell you this Mustang GT is no ordinary convertible! This car is much faster and handles better that advertised. The interior in our opinion isn't too shabby either! We really like the retro styling. It is quite similar to the Mustangs of the 60's and 70's. That is where the similarities end. The ride is unbelievable for a car this price. The interior is so quiet for a convertible And we haven't been able to detect any cowl shake. With the tires provided (Pirelli Zero Neros) you have to go out of your way to make this thing slide even a little. A very nice car!

Title: Overall performance of this car.
Review:  I just purchased my new 06 convertible Mustang.  All black!  This car is amazing.  Drives like sports car and the same time feels like you are driving an old Cadillac.  I was considering getting the V6, but after driving the V8 with manual transmission, I was convinced  that the V8 was my answer for my new toy! (hands down). If you're thinking about getting this car as an extra car for fun driving then I would recommend the manual V8.  If you enjoy music and have an extra few dollars then get the Shaker1000.

Review:  Sounds great for a six cylinder.  Great pick-up/power for a six cylinder - plenty of power.  Not too pricey for a sporty car like this - reasonably priced. Good buy for the money.  Shaker 500 sound system sounds great.  Gas mileage - about 20 mpg around town - is satisfactory.   I've had Camaros, Trans-Ams, a Corvette, and Mustangs, and this is my favorite so far.

Title: Car is really fast
Review:  I test drove many other sport convertibles, but liked the ride of the Mustang best. I would have picked the Honda 2000, but it is so tiny, you better be 135 lbs and 5'5". The Nissan 350Z was nice, but you feel every bump in the road. This car is great except the quality of the interior for the price. I had an F150 Lariat, and the interior quality was far better equal price. The leather seats are very nice, but at 5'10" I find my knee resting against the center console. The stereo is outstanding for a factory unit, but I could tell no difference in the quality between the Shaker 500 and the 1000 even though the 1000 comes with a sub in the trunk.

Title: The Red Beast
Review:  I’ve owned my red V6 Mustang for about 6 years now, it had 89k miles on it. It’s at 139k now. The car has never let me down or given me any problems. Regular maintenance and oil changes every 3k miles of course. I’ve had to fix the exhaust a couple occasions, due to potholes. It’s my daily driver all year in Wyoming. I’ve had it through some pretty rough snow too. I ride snow tires all year also, they’re just nicer tread quality in my opinion. And I drive a lot of gravel. I’ve been stuck once, but shoveled and threw chains on to get out no problem. And during some winter storms I chain up regularly to reach the highway. Everything in the car works. It burns very little oil. It’s fast enough and looks cool. Lots of after market mods available. I plan to get new shocks and struts next as they are looking rusty, but they still feel stiff. I average 20-23 miles on the highway. The value on these cars is way more then the few thousand dollars you can buy one for now.

Title: I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! THE BEST CAR EVER!
Review:  I absolutely love this car. I have had it for several years now.  I am now at over 220000 miles. I have considered buying a newer car but I am having a difficult time parting with this car. I bought it used and have only had minor issues that I really cannot complain about. The windows stopped working at separate times and the motors were replaced. The fuel pump was replaced. That's the only issues I have had with this car and I am not complaining. I keep up with maintaining the oil changes regularly as I do a lot of driving. I have had so many compliments on this car. It is a beauty. Many people think it is a GT. I cannot say enough about this vehicle. I purchased it used from a family who took excellent care of it. It had about 134000 miles on it when I bought it. I am surprised at how roomy the trunk is and how much I can actually get in there. I cannot tell you how many times I have heard "I love your car".  I have had newer cars than this and they may have been more roomier or higher priced but I would not trade this one in for any of them. I have decided to keep it until I can't keep in anymore. I just can't part with a car that has been so awesome! If you are considering buying this car don't hesitate but do your research. I bought from an honest family who took great care of this car. I also did a carfax before purchasing. I could not be happier with my 2000 Ford Mustang! Take care of it and it will take care of you.

Title: Kick butt old school
Review:  I avoided admitting my appreciation for late-model GTs for a long time just because it was so un-P.C.  But when the '99s came out I was intrigued.  I bought my black 2000 5-speed as a lightly-used and nicely-equipped example (leather, Mach 460 stereo, etc.) in mid-2001.  Words cannot express how much I loved that car.  I drove it for 12 years and nearly 180,000 virtually trouble-free miles before trading it in on my current 2013 GT 5.0.  The good:  great performance, chunky masculine style that turns heads, cheap to maintain, very reliable, just the right touch of attitude, the sound of a 2-valve V-8 roaring through an H-pipe, reasonable economy for the performance, a good level of practicality for what it is.  My kids fit in the back.  Limitless aftermarket modifications and go-fast parts supply.  My dealer is great.  You're the coolest dad at your kids' school.  Keeps everyone at church guessing.The bad:  not much.  There are cars with better quality interior trim, more refinement, and nicer fit and finish.  But anyone buying a Mustang knows it's no Lexus.The ugly:  the backwards-hat crowd in bespoilered front-drive compacts with fart cans always wants to show off in front of you.  Your neighbors may hate it, especially if you install Flowmasters and do a full-bore romp on the gas pedal at 6 a.m.  Or at least they'll think you're a hoon.  Self-righteous European car owners may think you're tacky (full disclosure...my wife has a newer BMW X3, we're just not full of ourselves over it).  Cop bait.  Bottom line:  If you want a fast car that is reasonably practical and has just the right dose of good-natured obnoxiousness built in, you've come to the right place.  For any pre-2005 Mustang I recommend welding in a good set of subframe connectors to stiffen up the body structure for the long haul, and then driving the heck out of it.

Title: It saved me!
Review:  My first beautiful 2000 Mustang V6 coupe, purchased in 2010, saved me when some tattooed meth freak hit my driver's door at 60mph as I was making a left turn on a small two lane (no passing zone). I was dazed but the car was totaled, as was f-wit's Honda. He walked away, donchaknow. The replacement, another base 2000 coupe, is even nicer, with fewer miles and the same excellent reliability. It has a bit of clutch chatter, but nothing's perfect. I enjoy every mile and am happy to have some steel wrapped around me!

The car still runs strong and I'm about to have the transmission serviced for the first time tomorrow at the Ford dealership (my friend recommended I do it, I kept topping off fluid every once in a while, nothing major, no leaks). The car still runs strong, shifts great, smooth ride. Added cold air intake, dual exhaust to give it a better sound and thats about it! Full synthetic oil changes at about 3,500 miles.

Review:  I've owned my 2000 Mustang GT for 4+ years now. Car now has 155K on her and she's still running strong. The only major failures I've had was the Intake Manifold coolant line busting & heater core leaking(major pain to fix). I've really driven this car hard, but always maintained it, and she is still going strong. Please stop listing to idiots bash a car because they 1. they neglect it. and 2. they give a bad rap because of normal Maintenance items they have to replace(rotors/pads/air filters/fuel filters/plugs). On a different note, after a few basic mods, these cars will run with the feared LS1 Camaro's.

Title: 1 1/2 years late......
Review:  I poasted a review of this car when i first got it in the begining of 2010. I have done NO engine or transmission work to this car. It has been very reliable and has never left me stranded. I did have to have it painted because of the cheap paint that ford used. This was my first car, and it's special to me, i named him "black stallion." My AC doesnt work, buttons started falling off the radio so i got a JVC radion/cd player installed. The ride isnt bad, the car doesnt jar your neck when you hit a bump like my grandpaws 2010 mustang. I tell myself that i want a new car, but everytime i get in "black stallion" i say, what was i thinking, this is my baby. Gas millage isnt that bad either.

Title: Built Ford tough
Review:  This Mustang is my 4th and I love it. The 5 spd tranny shifts smoothly, and the 4.6L engine has plenty of GITTYUP and GO. I get around 22-23 MPG on the highway. The exhaust sound is awesome. The Mach stereo system is OK and the instrument cluster is easy to read and watch. the leather interior is very comfortable and being 6'2" and 225 lbs, I have plenty of room in the drivers and passenger seats. I do not have room in the back even if the seats are moved forward, but I did not buy it to carry people around. I bought it for the PERFORMANCE. I have had camaros and trans ams, and the Mustang is my favorite. Plenty of aftermarket parts, so your bank account won't go empty if a repair pops up.

Put on a duel exhaust and an h pipe did a couple of tune up and the car has 342,425 miles on it. Engine runs very good does not burn oil and always starts up when called for. Body is showing some signs of wear and will need body work this year. I love the car and would not think of getting rid of it. Has the usual mechanical problems of any car with that many miles on it but I just love driving it. If I ever had to replace it I would look for another the same style and year

It is comfortable to drive and to ride in, but the backseat is cramped. but its a sports car so its not suppose to be big. The sound system is pretty good and i love the cd player, it plays homemade cds and it sounds good. I love to hear the roar of that engine when the rpm's get up to about 3000. I haven't had it long but so far i have to get the front right brake calapaer cleaned out, i need to plugs, and my clicker doesn't work but i can live without that.

Review:  Overall this is a decent car - But it's not the fast/fun mustang everyone makes it out to be.   The car is very slow when put side by side with other sport coupes of it's year.  The interior looks good, but is very very cheap. **EVERYTHING** rattles and makes noise inside the car.  The seats are very boring and uncomfortable,  and the worst part is terrible highway driving in 5th gear.  The car handles well in dry weather, but isn't very balanced.  The rear suspension is bad - leading to serious fishtailing out of turns , bad rain traction, and unstable turns if you hit any small bumps.  It's a reliable car,  but sport coupe? no...not really.

Review:  Got this car used with 65K miles, since I couldn't afford an Accord or Solara Coupe. Overall the car has been pretty good to me. No major repairs, just maintenance. This car is NOISY. Ford really cut a lot of corners when it came to quality and craftsmanship. Wind noise intrudes at high speeds and it feels like a shopping cart on rough roads. The power-steering wines, but this seems to be common. The seats are a joke, they offer little to no support up front. This cars goes through brakes fairly quickly. My driver's side windows sticks in hot weather, paint has faded, and the engine rattles at high RPMS. Transmission seal leaks are common as well, but that's been the most of my problems.

Title: Dangerous underpowered rust bucket
Review:  The car's interior is a joke.  Cheap, boring plastic.  It was outdated even for 20 years ago.  The V6 is severely underpowered.  Good luck accelerating in 5th gear unless you've got a ton of momentum.  Almost anything over an entry level 4 banger is faster.  In snow, it is undriveable.  In the rain, it is just plain dangerous.  Hydroplanes, and cannot get traction.  The car feels unsafe.  At high speeds, it was bumpy, and felt loosely connected to the road.  The car rusted out completely on bottom. Could pick chunks of rust off the frame.  I sold it to an unsuspecting buyer, who probably will have to part it out or crush it. In the near future.  AC was terrible. Tires go flat

I have done some performance work to my car (pullies, gears, exhaust w/o cats, cold air intake, and chip) so far I have had no problems with anything mechanical. I have replaced parts that are considered normal wear and tear (struts, shocks, and springs) at 100k.I still get a lot of compliments on my car now so the body design is holding up well. The interior could be made better, the door pieces break easily and the weather stripping on the door has been replaced 4 times.

Title: Ford dies fast
Review:  I initially bought this car brand new in 2000, and it was awesome. However, it quickly started to have some serious issues. I had to replace the alternator at 45K, and the rear end work at 55. My check engine light was on for 3 years, after multiple repeated attemts at fixing it finally was fixed. I had an Escort before the Mustang, and it had similar reliability issues.  My next car will be a Honda or Toyota.

Title: Reliable, Fun and Quick
Review:  My car has all the options and the mach stereo system. I have spent $0 repairing this Mustang other than neccesary ex. oil, fluids, and have had no problems. The v6 has plenty of power for the everyday user and unbelievable gas mileage on the highway. I put on a fuel induction preformance kit and now it sounds amazing, with great throttle response. I could not be happier!

Title: fun and sporty
Review:  Originally went to buy a Cougar - couldn't make the deal.  Went over to Ford and drove a used Mustang.  Most of the miles have been highway and the Stang is nothing but fun to take on a trip.  Mileage has been outstanding - upper 20's and occasionally getting into the 30's.  Changing the stock 15" wheels out for the 17" Mach 1 wheels made it even sportier and better handling. Even though the car is now 6 years old I still get compliments on it's sporty looks. Car has been flawless and reliable. Admittedly it is a little tough to drive in snow so it has been the summer time trip car.

Title: lots better than a Focus
Review:  When I went to the dealer to pick up the car, I passed a Focus in the lot selling for the same price as what I paid for the Mustang. Figured I got a much better car. After 106,000 miles, I couldn't be happier. Only thing I had to replace beside wear items was a idle pulley for $11. Brake pads lasted 60K miles and did not put brake dust on the wheels. I get 21 mpg with the alcohol/gas mixture they sell in Houston. Performance tires made the car handle much better in the rain. Engine accessibility with the v6 is excellent. Parts are cheap at parts store (not dealer).

Title: Still excited about driving this car
Review:  After 6 years, its still a thrill to drive this car.  This car is my daily driver, and it has never let me down.  Only maintenance problem that I have ever had was a fuel filter replacement ($200).  If you want to keep the stock tires on it (Goodyear Eagles z-rated), be prepared to shell out some cash.  Average z-rated tires last about 20-25K before needing replacement.  The car seems to get lighter in the front at higher speeds, but then settles down around 70-80.  Very throaty exhaust with tight suspension for turning.  Finally, I've never lacked power to get out of the path of bad drivers.  The 265 horses it comes with, makes it feel like the muscle car it was designed to be.

Title: My Experience
Review:  I bought this car with 16,000 miles on it for $9,000 dollars from a friend. It has been nothing but amazing since that day. I have added a cold air intake, tinted the windows and put on an amazing exhaust. I get about 30  miles per gallon in the highway and about 14 in the city (without any air conditioning). I had to change the CCRM which ran for about 140 dollars , but this seems to be a really rare problem, I was just unlucky. I would recommend different rims and tires, because traction in the rain is horrible; I have crashed 3 times. All of which kept my car in perfect condition, but ruined the other cars lol.

Review:  I'm 16 and I bought a 2000 Mustang GT as my first car. Having a 5 speed manual makes this car a blast to drive. The car handles beautifully in dry weather, have yet to drive it in anything wet. Since I am in high school, it's nice seeing heads turn everywhere I go. The full Flowmaster exhaust sure helps bring attention to my car. Only thing I have to say is it is a eye-catcher, especially for the COPS. So drive safe and be careful!

Title: Love this car!
Review:  I bought my car when it had 38k on it. Have not had any major mechanical issues and I just passed 80k. Have taken the car on a few road trips. It handles well, gets good gas mileage and the sound system is awesome. Am starting to experience a bit of loss in power, sounds like I may have a small exhaust issue towards the front of the vehicle, sometimes now when I shift the brake light comes on momentarily and if I rev the RPM's too high the battery light flashes. But all in all it is a great vehicle.

Title: Loved it at first...
Review:  Purchased my Mustang with less than 20 miles and enjoyed it until I hit the 40K mark. I have taken great care of my car hoping it would last a long time, but it hasn't made a difference. I have owned the car for over four years now and in the last year it has been literally falling apart. I have had problems with the brakes, the passenger door, the power side mirrors, the a/c, and the transmission. The car still turns heads as I approach but the loud engine kills the mood. I did not get my money's worth and I will not buy another Ford.

The performance is there if you dare to drive it like it is meant to be driven. I have had no maintenance problems. And the car just looks great.

Review:  I purchased this car in 2000 brand new. It had only 2.5 mi. on it when I test drove it. I have had other Mustangs in the past and this one is much better driving in inclement weather than the rest. I also believe it is the best built of all the past Mustangs. Throttle response in this one even today after 50,000 miles is incredible. Transmission is still a sure hook and the car has never let me down when it comes time to start it. I have even driven it in eight inches of snow and it got me home driving eleven miles. No problems with this car at all.

Title: Rock on Ford!
Review:  If you are looking for a car with an affordable price tag, good fuel economy, and good looks, look no farther. This car is way better than a Focus or Escort for looks and style, way safer, has decent power (for a V6), and still gets 27 mpg. Sure it doesn't have the power of the awesome V8, but I wasn't looking for a racer,  I was looking for decent MPG and good looks; this car has both.  And it still has the great Mustang name.  Why buy a Taruas or Focus when this car is out there?

Title: Everything I dreamed it would be...
Review:  This car is amazing! There are only two things wrong with it. The trunk opening is TINY even though the trunk is really big. The other thing is that the front cup holder is dangerously close to second gear. Other than that this car is great. Interior/exterior styling is breathtaking. The throaty engine will throw your organs into the back seat if you floor it. Handles like a dream. Gas mileage is very acceptable; so far it's been better than my 2.0L Celica. The seats are comfortable; test drive a Celica if you want to feel pain. Anyway, we all know it's your dream to have one so stop punishing yourself and go buy it.  The price is low when it's used, so insurance is the only problem.

Vehicle: 2017 Genesis G90 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.3L 6cyl Turbo 8A)
Title: This car is the real deal
Review:  I have never posted an online review of a car, but the G90 deserves a review.  The most economical way to describe it is 85% of an S Class at 60% of the price.  In my case, because of the lease cash available, I paid roughly 50% of what I would have paid for a comparably equipped S Class.  My previous car was a 2015 Hyundai Genesis, which I really like even though it had two issues-- the dealer service was beyond awful (I got sub-Hyundai level service as a Genesis owner) and the build quality was a bit lacking (rattles in the front left wheel, behind the glove compartment and in the sunroof that were never resolved).  I think the service issue will be resolved as Genesis narrows its dealer network.  The concierge service likely will also help, but I have not used it yet.  So far, the build quality on my G90 has been flawless.  The technology on the car is impeccable.  Nothing groundbreaking, but it has everything you would want (other than Apple CarPlay and Android Auto) and, more important, everything is intuitive and easy to use.  You can adjust the climate, use the navigation and use the media with minimal distraction.  The ride quality is exceptional.  This car is true luxury.  If you are shopping for a car in which to pamper yourself, make sure you look at this one.  I know there is a certain snob appeal to a Mercedes, BMW or Audi badge, but you can impress your friends just as much by proving you are smart enough to save tens of thousands of dollars, while still driving in luxury.

I'm 6'6", 274 and like to hike, kayak, camp, explore and hunt. The H3T has more room than the fullsize and better built than any smaller truck including the toyota. The H3T is a mid size, can tow enough and is comfortable for me.With 20,000 miles on it, I intend on keeping this vehicle for the next 15-20 years. With taller narrow tires and driving speed limit, I get 20 city mpg and 24 highway. Wish GM still built these but with a 5cyl diesel in it. GM bring it back please!!

Vehicle: 2009 HUMMER H3T Crew Cab Alpha 4dr Crew Cab 4WD SB (5.3L 8cyl 4A)
Title: Soon to be a Classic
Review:  This is my second Hummer. I previously had an '08 H3 and loved it but always wanted the 'T'. Being a limited production vehicle, I finally found one I could afford as the resale prices have started to rise. Like the one before, this also is an Alpha. Same color, Solar Flair. The smoothness and power of the V8 far outweighs anything you give back on fuel mileage. I've driven an I-5 equipped H3T and there's really no comparison. The size of the cargo bed is quite handy and really not an issue as I didn't purchase it for hauling large loads. That's not it's forte. Driving it does take some getting use though because the average truck has for more square feet of glass to look out of but when you get acclimated to the interior it's quite comfortable and the setting sun, because of the short overhang of the windscreen, is never an issue.  It could use more storage space and cup holders for the rear seat area. I do remember there was an insert available on my H3 for the back seat that had a cup holder in it. Don't know why that wasn't offered as standard equipment. Overall, I truly enjoy driving the truck. Chances are you'll never see another one at a stoplight. And just like the first series early Bronco's, these will only increase in value.

Title: HUMMER TOUGH
Review:  I have owned my H3T Alpha since the end of August.  I have 2,659 miles on it.  This truck is very nice to drive however slightly uncomfortable for long drives as the driver's side leg room is awkward.  I find myself adjusting every 5 minutes.  The sound system is pretty good however my H2 has a Bose system that definitely sounds a ton better.  Speaking of which my H2's seats are like a Lazy Boy Recliner where as the H3T seats are not as cushy more firm not as wide.  The truck does drive very comfortably and handles extremely well in the snow.  My biggest gripe is that the EPA window sticker states 13 mpg  city 16 mpg highway.  At best I have gotten just under 13, and I drive mostly highway

Title: Exactly what a car should be
Review:  You really need to drive one the 2006-2011 Azeras. The ride is unbelievably perfectly balanced for people who realize they won't be taking corners at 100+mph and no car can make a 10inch deep pothole disappear. If you want a car with good speed, but no drama getting there....this is the car. The ride feel like smooth and quiet, yet alive enough to let you know what the road is like underneath you (my guess is the complaints about ride comfort come from people used to buick marshmallows). We've had this beauty for almost a decade and had absolutely zero issues. Kept her outside in snowy, salty climate and no rust anywhere. None of the drivers in our house have led-foot-itis so we can attest to 20mpg "suburb" being the norm (I did notice a drop down to 19mpg the week I needed to go in to the city for jury duty). Seriously, this car is perfect. It has superb visibility, go ahead and compare it to one of those dreadful new cars with window sills nearly at shoulder height. We drove this car through ice storms and blizzards with no problems (as long as you keep traction control OFF). I am completely in love with this car. So bright and cheerful and I swear it just loves to be driven. We got the base model with the rather unusual upholstery, but good lord this stuff is comfortable. It never heats up in the summer nor does it ever feel frigid in the winter, to heck with leather.... I've actually grown to love just sitting in the passenger seat while the others shop. (The great sound system compliments the relaxing seats very well too) Oh yeah, the usable cargospace is unsurpassed....thrift stores and consignment furniture shops have been our favorite places since getting this car. How Hyundai did this car for the pricepoint is unimaginable, it completely destroys Avalons/Accords/Fusions/Impalas/MKS...and even my 5-series. You have to love this car.

Title: Honey Hyundia
Review:  This one of the best cars that I have ever owned. In my lifetime I have had 15 cars, 2 used and 13 new. This car without a doubt has been exceptional.It is going to be 10 years old soon and other that brakes, tires and batteries, nothing else has had to be replaced. The leather interior looks as good as the day  one, along with the body and paint. I haven't even had to change a light bulb. It is a great car!!!!

Title: Good as a used car
Review:  I bought the Azera as a less expensive alternative to an Avalon. I have had a disappointing (bad) experience with Hyundai National after problems with air bag. A local repair successfully fixed the problem after dealer missed the problem repeatedly. The Seat belt pre tensioners have been a problem possibly exacerbated by my purchase of used replacements. The rear power sunscreen failed at about 200K and replacing it is exorbitant. It handles very well and the fine touches are well executed. I am looking for another Azera.

Review:  We bought our 06 one owner Azera for my daughter.It had 93K miles but was well cared for.We have had the car for a year and the engine and interior are top notch.Highway mileage is 27 but in the city it is abysmal.The rear sunshade is a gimic and trouble prone.The car is solid and is a good value used as Hyundai's still don't hold their value as well as the Japanese cars but in my opinion are similar in quality.

Title: Great car!
Review:  This was my first car that I got for my 15th birthday. It is a great car. I see lots of reviews mentioning the harshness of bumps. Honestly, I don't see the problem. It rides so smoothly. The interior is amazing. Very classy steering wheel, plus very comfortable on the hands. It's got a list of very cool features. The steering wheel leans back when the car is turned off as if to get out of the driver's way. Heated seats, electrically powered seat adjusting, sun roof, etc. There is even a mile counter counting down to an empty gas tank. Speaking of gas, this must be the only feature less than excellent. The gas mileage could be slightly better. All in all, it's a really great car!

Great family car and preformance is awesome. I understand the complaint about ride comfort. Get different tires. Thats all. Sumitomo HTR Z III are cheap and amazing tires. you can get them for under 500 bucks for all 4. The Azera is my favorite car overall.

Title: Enjoying it with reservations
Review:  Read all the reviews before buying it. could not get more than 14MPG, under any circumstances, hated that the key fob kept hitting the plastic dash and absolutely hated the ride. I was told to wait till I drove it a while before I can expect better gas mileage. At my first oil change, a young mechanic reinstalled the software that runs the engine and I immediately obtained 17.8 MPG around town and 27 MPG on the highway. I installed a plastic change purse over the key fob to silence the key chain. It worked. I stopped by another dealer to complain about the ride. He installed new shocks on the front and it now rides almost acceptably. I only have 8000 miles on it.

My brother bought the 2007 and his dashboard also cracked in the same place, on the passenger side where the airbag is located. Many owners complain about gas mileage but for its size 22mpg combined is not bad. I would highly recommend a Hyundai to anyone, its a good car and the company stands behind all of the models.

Review:  Good daily driver that is also good highway traveler.  SHIFTRONIC transmission make driving in mountains of Colorado and Utah a pleasure and prevents overheating brakes. Engine, transmission and mechanical perform well in 110+ degree desert heat. Paint has held up well in cloudless sunny skies of Arizona. The battery needed replacement after 2 years, the coolant tank cracked (but did not leak) and the dash top cover cracked, and all were replaced free under warranty by dealer. The seat, foot pedal and steering column adjustments combined with the integrated memory system easily accommodates out 2 drivers who have an 8 inch height difference.

Title: A Car to Consider
Review:  I had to replace my 97 Camry. Owning all kinds of cars in the past (Lexus- Benz-Honda-Audi) this one made sense. Things I love: safety features (airbags all around, stability and traction control + the usual - ABS etc.), power (250 hp), transmission (smooth, gear stays on until red zone if you hit it), comfort (seats, rear A/C - heat fan, illuminated power switches, auto up/down window for driver & pass), optional features (front & REAR reading lights, huge trunk, good stereo), and highway gas mileage (28). Major gripe: If you want a sporty car this is not it. On straight road it is great. BUT smooshy on curves (just like a Buick). Minor stuff: City MPG could be better. Buy used not new.

Title: I laugh at BMW buyers
Review:  I am a previous owner of a 2000 Dodge Intrepid ES with the 3.2l engine. For about the same price as I paid for the Trep in 2000, I have a fully loaded LE that has so far been almost flawless. Now after 50,000 miles, I am still impressed. Initially I was scared to try Hyundai after my sister owned a Sonata back in the 90's, and that car literally fell apart. This car has been rock solid and I have only had 2 issues, and all were replaced free of charge by the dealership. The fact that this car has an excellent warranty and free roadside assist sold me. The car looks classy but a bit conservative. It rides a bit mushy but my second set of tires (Goodyear F1) has improved handling.

The gas mileage definitely needs improvement. I love all the bells and whistles, like when a large SUV gets behind me at night. The lights used to shine right in my eyes. Now I just hit the back reflector shade and the night time driving button on the rear view mirror. I drove up to NY from Fla in 19 hours averaged 68 mph and averaged 28 mpg. I recommend the car.

Title: A lot of car for the price I paid.
Review:  Nobody thought I'd buy this car, including me, but I haven't regretted since.  A lot of power for its curb weight.  The other day, I had no problem keeping up with a Mazdaspeed 3 on the freeway going 90mph.  Like some people say, you don't realize how fast you are going because the ride is very quiet and smooth.  Of course, it also helps that Hyundai has such long warranties on it.  Haven't had need to take it back to dealer yet though.  Roomy interior and superb upholstery, though not leather, all the nice touches are there including the "fake" wood plastic finish.  Large trunk. Exterior styling is ok, but not the best.  But for a $23K car, it's not bad.

He must have done his review driving around in 3rd gear. I get 26 to 28 mpg combined mileage, about half city and highway. I am an All-American, but I love just about everything about this car. Easy on tires? I am just about to buy the first set of replacement tires, going to get 235's this time; it will be even better. This car will not disappoint someone who wants a very smooth ride. It's quick, very comfortable with a big trunk for all my things, and a ton of very usable features...Ed

Review:  I have had this car for over 2 years now and am still impressed. I am also surprised that I see so many Sonatas on the road and so few of these! I was afraid to gamble on Hyundai after a bad experience in the early 90's but the warranty sold me. The first year warranty seems to replace ANYTHING (I didn't need to use it) and the roadside assistance package can't be beat. This car has a nice but a bit conservative look. The led tail lights make things stand out some. This car has a lot of power and it is easy to be going close to 100 without even feeling it. The car does have a little soft ride and corners a little sloppy for my taste but it is an impressive car overall.

With average 24 mpg on my Azzie, I can't complain at all.  This was my first luxury sports sedan, driving ~2500 miles monthly for a supermarket chain, all over 5 counties in Tampa bay area.  The overall comfort, power to pass/merge, and styling are it's strong points, not to mention pricing when comparing other imported large sedans.

The seats are amazingly comfortable and memory seats make it easy to switch drivers. Fuel economy is very good for a large car: 22-24 city, 27-29 highway. Service has been excellent so far. We compared ride to Avalon and found this less floating and more sporty. You feel like you have a fast car, but very good at holding road and over bumps. Great car- big surprise.

The guy even asked to sit it in. Beautiful was his comment! Couldn't believe it was 2 years old. Loved the whole car and was going to visit a dealer soon.   I love the features inside, attention to detail is equal to those other high-end cars. Power when you need to pass. My son played with the auto shift. Cool he said!

Review:  We bought our Azera new two years ago because an Azera passed our Mazda going up a steep hill. We weren't used to that. Can't understand anyone who says this car doesn't go like stink.  There were two models available and we got the one with the V6 3.8 engine (the cheaper model had a different motor -- the overview doesn't mention that so maybe a Canadian option) and all the bells and whistles. The ONLY vehicle that comes close is the Passat and we leave it behind on hills. The passing performance is simply spectacular which we need because we pass a lot of big trucks on icy roads.  Fabulous car. More for comfort than performance? I think not.

Title: Hope they can fix or won't buy another.
Review:  Impressed by the fit, finish, and options for the money. Didn't like the way the transmission shifted from day one. Under light throttle at 20-30 mph it can't seem to decide what gear it should be in. Also, torque converter lock up frequently won't release under load on a grade without first forcing a 5-4 downshift. More recently, I have been experiencing an intermittent but pronounced bucking/jerking under light load at 25-40 mph. It appears to be related to torque converter lock up problems. Engine is noisy (probably piston slap) until fully warmed up. Suspension transmits a lot of noise over rapid bumps such as rail road tracks or rough pavement. Tire noise is apparent on smooth roads.

It has slipped on many occasions especially after getting off a highway onto city streets.  The service dept. even told me that if my wife drives different than me than the car will not learn how to shift properly!! Who would make a car like that?  My wife will not even drive it any more, she hates the transmission that much.  Too bad because most everything else is good.  Getting rid of it soon.

Title: I have 2 2006 Azera Limiteds
Review:  I bought my first 2006 Azera Limited brand new in November, 2006.  My parents bought a used 2006 Azera Limited in Spring, 2007.  I bought another used 2006 Azera Limited with 14,000 miles in February, 2007.  I have owned 3 Cadillac DeVilles and 2 Cadillac Sevilles since 1995. Although the Azera does not have the Cadillac ride, I still like it better than the Cadillacs.  The gas mileage in town has been around 17 but on the road I get mid 20s.  Obviously, I am sold on the Azera Limited.  I hope the resale values are better in a few years. I look forward to the introduction of the Genesis this summer.

Title: Azera Problems
Review:  Gas mileage less than 12 mpg city; told car should have at least 10K   miles before you get good mileage. Had car in 3 times; told everything normal, "that's what you should expect". Combined city/highway only 17 with >50% expressway. Minor items: accelerator very sensitive on starting; doesn't shift to highest gear til 40 mpg (told normal); keys bump against steering column; no coin holder for tolls, parking meters; light beige interior shows dirt readily.

Review:  Gas mileage is terrible. No front seat drivers side leg room. Not a car to drive if you are over six feet tall. Battery drains after 3-4 days of being parked. Hyundai says that is normal(?) Transmission never knows what gear it wants to be in. No reason to buy this car as long as they are building Accords and Camrys.

Title: Why drive anything else?
Review:  I've owned many different cars in the last 32 years - all European, and I've kept an eye on the market. The Azera is, in my opinion, the best luxury car you can get for the money. To get a comparably equipped car from anyone else, you'd have to spend at least $5k more, and you probably still wouldn't have rain-sensing wipers. The Azera is very quick, handles well, and has clean, distinctive, styling. And don't forget the LED tail lights, as they afford those behind you an extra margin when you're stopping. Though city economy is not great, I've consistently acheived 28+ MPG on the highway. I just don't see how you could go wrong. This is the frugal buyers luxury car!

Review:  I have driven this car for about 14 months now and have no complaints or gripes. and it is $4000.00 cheaper than it's nearest competitor. I test drove all the vehicles in it's class,domestic and foreign, and found nothing better in that price range. In the categories listed above. I was a local car salesman so I have driven a lot of cars from Maserati's to Yugo's and I love this car. I have gotten out of a lot of tight scrapes and dangerous driving situations with this car,It saved my life in handling. This car does what Hyundai says it would.

Title: A Cheap BMW!
Review:  I have owned this car for over a year now and it has been worth every cent so far. I was scared to trust a Hyundai after my sisters experience with a Sonata back in the 90's but the warranty made me take the risk. This car has operated flawlessly since ownership. Like all cars, there are good and bad but this car has been a winner. I am a previous Dodge Intrepid owner and was impressed with the quality, performance and comfort. My only gripe with this car is the shadow that hangs over the driver side low beam headlight. I have heard others complain about this and am still searching for a fix. Other than that, avoiding tickets is my main concern with this cruiser.

I put it on a 24 hr charger, and have had no problems since! ( This happened January, 07) Bumpy ride over rough roads. Very Quiet interior, I sometimes try to start it after it's been running, due to no engine sounds inside the car. Overall, it's been the "best car", I've ever owned. Very spacious interior.

Title: Impressive Hyundai
Review:  I've owned my Azera almost 9 months and have enjoyed every minute.  I was prepared to buy an '07 Sonata but after test driving some leftover '06 Azeras on the lot, I was hooked.  I ended up paying about $1200 more than I would have for a new Sonata and got a heck of a lot more car.  People can't believe it's a Hyundai.  It's not a tight "sporty" ride.  Handling is a bit drifty, but it's a bigger, softer car.  BUT, with 263 ponies under the hood, this car is NOT shy.  Styling is sharp and contemporary.  Not one "cheap" element to this vehicle.  I just don't understand why Hyundai has so heavily marketed the Sonata when this gem is out there.  Just test drive it!

Title: Fast, but you pay for the power
Review:  We have put about 26K on our 2006 Azera SE.  Bought it for about 22K.  Lots of zip but overall gas mileage right about 21.5. Have had some issues with it (a/c compressor overvoltage, rear windows not going down, crack in dash) but dealer has been very good about fixes.  As with most dealers, service dept tries to make a lot of money.  Saying that I had to flush and fill transmission at 30K to keep warranty. 175 dollar deal.  Easy to change trans fluid yourself on this car. Finally pinned them down and flush/fill not required to meet warranty, just drain and refill.  Keep receipts for trans oil, of course and use special Hyundai oil like the book says.

Review:  Purchased used 2006 Azera Ltd. with 15,200 miles.  Tremendous car.  I miss the smoother ride of the XG350 I previously had, which was sacrificed in the Azera for better/sportier handling, however; I knew that when I purchased it.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the combination of handling, quiet ride (it's still very smooth) and performance/fuel efficiency from the 3.8 liter engine.  The interior features are all top notch with tons of space for comfort.  Six air bags and electronic stability control add some peace-of-mind safety features.

Title: You'll be pleasantly suprised
Review:  After over 230,000 miles on my Toyota Camry LE wagon, I began looking for a replacement that would not only be as reliable as the Toyota, but also well- made and safe.  I looked at several comparable vehicles and consulted many consumer resources (kbb, edmunds, JD Powers, Consumer Reports, etc.), and chose the Azera as the best value overall.  I have the Limited Edition pearl white exterior with the light gray interior, leather seats, beautiful wood trim, sun roof, rear sun shade, with dual climate control.  The ride is very comfortable and quiet, with minimal wind/road noise.  The fit and finish is comparable to models with higher price tags.  People have asked what import model I drive! :-)

Title: Hyundai has a Luxury Sedan, WHAT?!
Review:  Yes, This is a luxury sedan in every way.  It's outward appearance wants to be a sports sedan, but it is not.  With that being said Pros: Good Gas mileage on regular gas, cup holders are located perfectly, LARGE truck, dual zone HVAC, Heated and cooled front seats, Heated back seats, ONLY CAR (not minivan) I know that has an electronic rear window shade and manual passenger window shades(my kids LOVE them), tilting side mirrors in reverse, steering is fluid and great turning radius giving you the sense you are dirivng a lighter and smaller car.  CONS: not a sports sedan!, steering is fluid and has a little over steer especially at high speeds, window controls on driver side are too far back(I need to push my elbow into my gut to get the rear windows down), sunroof is complicated to work. Even with the 19" wheels it rides well, at 6' tall I can sit in the back seat comfortably,  cool interior lighting at night.  It sucks that I don't love the outside as I wanted a sports sedan (last car was an infiniti q40) - but I do really like this car. The technology package is a real bonus, but I did buy the extended warranty.

Review:  Previously had a 2009 Genesis 4.6 - great car but rear wheel drive was a problem for Indiana winters.  After four years, switch to another brand auto, but neither the car or the service was what I had with Hyundai. The Azera is the only front-wheel drive from Hyundai that is in this class.  Extremely comfortable, fun to drive, great features, and extremely good value. This is our fourth Hyundai, and their customer service is equal to or better that what I experienced with my three BMWs, one Infiniti, and one Acura - I have absolutely no reason to go to another brand.

I own a 2012 Hyundai Azera it has engine problem I took it to the dealer several times for the same issues. The problem with the car is that it’s shaking it vibrates they call it rough idle when it’s turn it on when you drive it you feel it less but when you stop at a light or park it while the car is still on the entire car is shaking. Long story short they put a brand new engine in my car guess what? I still have the same exact issue with the car. At the end the corporate said there is nothing els they can do.

Title: Best deal i've ever gotten
Review:  I have a good friend who has a 2014 version under the old nomenclature, and while I originally thought the car was a little odd looking (i still do), i really enjoyed riding in it.  I finally decided to get a new car in 2017 and after looking at all the midsize SUV's available, i drifted over to the Qx70 because i wanted something fun to drive and the car had gone out of production so i felt i could get a good deal on one.  I actually got a spectacular deal on a CPO with 4400 miles on it ($36K for a car with a $52K sticker) and 42 months of mfer warranty left.  It was a corporate owned vehicle used by a Nissan exec.  My gain points out a negative- this vehicle really depreciates in its first year- so if you buy one you need to keep it.   I purposely stayed away from the sport and limited because the 18 inch wheel has a lot more air and rubber on the wheels vs the 20/21 inch wheels - it makes a difference in softening the ride. I think the big wheels look great but i wanted a more standard issue tire.   The technology is old but proven- no trips to the dealership for bugs in the driver assist functions or transmission. Nav has both touchscreen and button panel- its a little far away for touchscreen when driving but buttons are intuitive.  The car drives wonderfully.  The responsiveness is off the charts and the rear-wheel drive acceleration is smooth and powerful.  I just love driving it and it is more comfortable than i expected.  The biggest negative is the fuel economy- 17/21 with premium fuel adds up.  But i knew that going in and the deal i got will pay for a lot of fuel!   GREAT CAR!!!

Title: Meh...not really that impressed
Review:  I rented this car and spent 900 miles in it (I got in with 8 miles, returned with 908).  Overall, I was expecting better.  Cabin was nice and well appointed.  Buttons were easily placed and generally everything was intuitive and easy to use.  Given that it was January and I was in northern Minnesota, I was impressed by the stability control intervention, which was quick and predictable when cornering and the rear started to break away.  Kept me on the road pointed the right direction, and there was no tire spinning or anything.  As with a lot of Infiniti SUVs, the cabin is a bit claustrophobic and outward visibility is below average.  I really had to crane my neck to look over my shoulder and around blind spots.  If road conditions were at all undulating, the ride was very jumpy and uncomfortable.  You could really see it when the headlights were on; they were bobbing up and down and all of that was transmitted into the cabin.  The USB integration was sporadic.  Sometimes it would start up right away, others it would get stuck on "reading file" and require a lot more monkeying around with it before music would play.  But what was most noteworthy, in a negative sense, was the gas mileage.  I drove the 900 miles in less than a week, so my driving was mostly highway.  Yet it returned below 20 mpg as an average.  For a 20+ gallon tank, range was *barely* 400 miles.  I'm not a rocket accelerator, nor do I drive like a speed demon (on the interstate, I have the cruise pegged right around the speed limit).  Add to that the engine requires premium gasoline.  In this day and age, for a smaller SUV, that kind of mileage is flat-out poor.  On the same route with my Cayenne and driving the same style, I get 24-25 mpg.  As a result, I would say that while there are some things to like about the QX70, there are much better options out there.

Title: 2017 QX70 Limited
Review:  Owned a 2004 FX35, was the best car I've ever owned, had 240K mi when I hit a deer squarely front and center, airbags deployed, and insurance totalled the car.  Besides cosmetic damage after hitting the deer while traveling 75 mph, there was no structural or mechanical damage. I drove it home with the deflated airbags flapping.  Would not have survived in a smaller, lower vehicle. This is the first time I've bought the same car again, just a newer version. The car is gorgeous, powerful, loaded and comfortable. Already took it on T-giving trip from FL to KY.  Technology is well placed and easy to access, phone is sync'd via bluetooth, and USB cord adds all my music on board. SAT, AM, FM and aux are a simple push of a button, all with great sound. It doesn't lack anything I want, except the middle retractable cup holder on the floor in the back that the FX35 had. The gearing is growing on me; it revs high at start out in low gears, near 3000, then shifts to around 2000.  Different from the FX35, but still smooth and powerful. 21 inch tires on dark grey wheels looks awesome, and handles like a sports car.  Very happy!8 months later, I wouldn't change a thing, except the phone via bluetooth . . . it takes voice commands, then asks me to verify it got it right by picking a number, and it displays 5 names from my contact list, and the one I want is always #1.  I wish I could bypass the verification and have it just call.  I also added 3M clear bra to the front, mirrors, and door handles.  Great product, protects from bug chips and can't see it except up close if you're looking for the line across the hood.Just over a year later, still love it.  Some quirky anomalies have started with the music / phone interface, but I haven’t been able to get it to the dealer to check it out. Still works, but sometimes differently than it should.  Just over 29K miles, and with oil changes, tire balance, rotation and front end alignment every 5K miles, it drives like new, still looks brand new, and my daughter says it still smells new.  Lost count of how many strangers have commented on how beautiful the car is.  Just bought an ‘18 Mercedes GLA 250 for my wife, and the salesman had to go outside and drool over it, and he had a $337K Maybach in his showroom.  This Infiniti QX 70 Limited, in my opinion, is the star of the entire Nissan/Infiniti menu.

Title: Fastest naturally aspirated SUV (still!)
Review:  0-60 in 4.8 seconds.  *This* is the first stat potential FX50 or V8 QX70 owners should consider.  Handles like it's velcroed to the road, especially in the rain.  Firmly pegged on the "Sport" end of the SUV spectrum, these unique finds benefit significantly from a more involved driver's hand.  While clearly geared toward fuel economy--I've observed a surprising 19.5 MPG over three months'-worth of mixed driving, the seven-speed's "Drive Sport" mode is a must-engage when turning onto the twisties.  But only full manumatic, keeping RPMs above 3k, unleashes the bionic cheetah within.  This is my third Nissan-sourced V8 and a more Ferrari-esque take in terms of factory tuning for horsepower over torque.  That said: you will feel the extra hundred foot-pounds of twist, compared to the 3.5 or 3.7 sixes, with any significant change in elevation. And despite a somewhat CX-yawn exterior, the 2014's enlarged grill (masking dual engine air intakes), 21" custom Enkei rims, and 5.0 side badges subtly communicate that this beast shares 370Z & GT-R DNA and would best be left to prowl far afield from the minivan-ified crossover herd.

From my impressions this vehicle offers very engaged driving experience which no other car in this price category can offer, very unique and beautiful design inside and out in my opinion, and great performance to back up the package. Avg mpg on 5.0 v8 is 18.2

Vehicle: 2016 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A)
Title: Overall good quality
Review:  My QX70 came with AWD and Premium Package. I find the front seating and ride very comfortable. It's actually fun to drive.  I rate handling and the feel of the road as excellent. The instrumentation and controls are also excellent and easy to live with. The heated leather seats are nice for cold weather. Exterior fold-in side mirrors add a nice touch and are easily adjusted using the inside controls. Cons: No LED daytime running lights unless you get the Sports Package with the upgraded front bumper. That's just sad! The lack of hidden enterior storage under the rear deck. There is just enough room for the temporary spare, lug wrench and jack but no room for a small tool bag, pliers or a screw driver. Lastly, accepts only Premium gas.

Vehicle: 2015 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A)
Title: Big, Sporty SUV
Review:  I looked at a used QX70 in comparison to a QX50.  Was originally looking at 2015 models or earlier. The QX70 was nice, but just too big for me (I'm 5'-4" & at 63 y.o., I'm not going to get any taller) It was just too tall for me to step into.  Once I found out that the QX50 was lengthened in 2016, thereby giving it an extra 5" of legroom in the rear seat area, I opted for that one. My family has owned (& still own) several Infiniti's since 2003 & we have been extremely satisfied with the styling, acceleration, road handling, low maintenance & convenience options.

Vehicle: 2015 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A)
Title: Great Performance Hampered by Horrible Technology
Review:  I owned three Infiniti FX cars - 2006, 2009, 2012.   Was finalizing purchase of 2015 QX70.The majority of the really important things on a car - safety, drive, handling, reliability - all of my cars were excellent.   There were a few areas of concern over the years, and since the model doesn't seem to have changed in over a decade, they continued to be issues.    Rear seat room was adequate, but due to the shape of the rear doors, getting in and out was a problem for some passengers.  Kids should be fine.   Rear cargo capacity was fine for me -- but this isn't going to provide the mega-capacity of some SUVs.Most recently had a car in Midnight Mocha with brown leather interior - a nice deep root beer color.   The metallic exterior paint appears as a deep, eggplant purple in many lighting situations, including daylight/sunlight.   The basic interior choices for the car are either graphite gray or light wheat.   The brown interior results in a hodgepodge incomplete look - a sort of cheap, half-finished shortcut.   Seats and parts of the dash are substituted with nice brown leather, but all other leather and trim remains the standard graphite - such as the doors, portions of the dash, etc.   Brown floormats over the basic graphite carpet looks odd.   That's poor attention to detail reminiscent of a half-finished job or a cover-up.  Since all other exterior color combos provide for graphite or wheat interior, this issue should only occur with a Mocha/brown leather equipped car.  The car was fun to drive, and had great exterior styling.However, for any driver who finds technology to be important - the FX and QX70 miss the mark by alot.   ALOT.    The software and user interface for Navigation, Bluetooth, and audio entertainment are bad.   Just plain bad.   Test other cars, and almost all will demonstrate much better controls and interfaces.   Only one USB outlet in the car, voice interface that works poorly and freezes are some of the problems.   Limited information display when using your own devices via bluetooth or USB, and even for the Satellite radio.   No ability to control music selection with voice commands.  But the most astonishing problem is the severely outdated navigation dataset loaded into new cars.   Whatever source Infiniti uses for nav-data is horrible.   Roads and business in existence for several years simply don't appear in the Infiniti's Nav.   Not even brand new cars.  As I prepared to buy the QX70, my fourth Infiniti, I decided to pay particular attention to the Nav/entertainment system.   I tried several different automobile brands.   I found that design and software varied from manufacturer to manufacturer - with many aspects of the Infiniti being the worst.   I made a list of several destinations, all established in early 2014 or in prior years, and then tested the 2015 cars from several manufacturers.   Even tested the 2016 QX70.    Not one business from 2013 or 2014 was found on the Nav dataset in the 2015 or even the 2016 QX70.   At least 80% were found in all of the other 2015 cars, and often 100%.If you don't care about user toys/entertainment/navigation --- then the QX70 is a fantastic car.   If driving a relatively high-priced premium automobile with horrible technology, out-performed and out-designed by many budget cars will bother you.... avoid the QX70.   Or, at least test these systems in the QX70 before finalizing a purchase/lease decision.   After 9 years, I decided it bothered me too much, so I switched to another manufacturer's crossover.    I'll check back in on the Infiniti when I'm ready for a new car in a few years - if the technology is updated and comparable to other manufacturers, I'll probably return to being an infiniti owner.

Title: Yet to find anything better
Review:  I love my I35. It has great power for a V6, comfortable and reliable. I tend to drive this car pretty rough and it has held up to everything I put it through. I purchased mine used with 96k miles, I've owned it for 8 years now, going past 235k miles and have only made minimal repairs (power steering hose, oil cooler gasket, alternator(due to not being careful when putting oil in the car and it dripping down onto the windings), and the radiator(due to a minor accident)). To say this car is reliable is an understatement. I try to work on my own cars whenever possible and this car is very easy to make repairs on, when needed. When and if this car ever kicks the bucket, I will definitely be looking for another one as a replacement.

Review:  Rock solid car, strong, reliable engine, roomy passenger compartment, power and heated everything, and has a rear window shade. Replaced the radiator recently due to cracks.  Replaced the struts assemblies. New BF Goodrich Tires only have a few thousand miles wear. Have recently replaced the factory stereo with a new Kenwood (Excelsior model) CD, stereo with all inputs, jacks.   All major maintenance performed at Infiniti dealership. Oil always changed every 3,500 miles.   Paint is still terrific. A few dings. Interior leather has a few small tears.  This is a really good value.  Sold the vehicle through CarLotz Auto Consignment in Richmond, VA (West Broad St location) in early September 2016.

Review:  I bought this car brand new SIX years ago!  It's still running like a champ with 113,000 miles on it.  (I'm an assertive driver, ok AGGRESSIVE)  It's almost ready for second replacement of tires.  I've only  replaced 2 things, shocks/struts. (again, I don't drive like a grandmother and I live on country roads) and an engine gasket. Everything else has been regular maintenance.  Drives great in snow, I've only been stuck twice in my country driveway.  I don't usually keep cars this long.. I get tired of them, but I haven't found anything better for my money.  Will keep for my teenage daughter to drive in a couple years.  Probably the only car I would ever buy used..  if I could find one!

Title: A cadillac of an Infiniti
Review:  My Dad had this and passed away with 13K miles on it. It was his third I35. I took the car and bought it out after the lease was up. It's 2010 and I have 46,000 miles on it and it drives like the day I got it. This car has been great. It's a big cushy ride with a huge interior and trunk, a monster of a 3.6 liter engine that goes like a bat out of hell. Only con is the mileage but all of the Nissan 3.6 liter engines are beasts and don't get good mileage. Otherwise, the car has been flawless.  All in all, this was Infiniti's version of a Cadillac and I expect to have it for a long time barring any unforeseen breakdowns. I guess I'll get a G37 when the interior breaks down.

Review:  I bought my 2004 Infiniti I35 in October of 2008 with 45,000 miles from an Infiniti dealer. I now have 66,000 miles on the car. I think the car has ample power although I would have liked to see more. I would expect better gas mileage, I drive mostly city and get only 17 MPG. I like the size of the car, it has plenty of room front and rear. I like the rear sunshade it keeps the car cool and gives some privacy. The Bose sound system is really nice.

Great sound system, excellent climate control system, the heated seats and heated steering wheel have spoiled me this past winter. Huge trunk, fold down seats make carrying my 88 key digital piano a breeze. Cruise control is smooth, radio controls on steering wheel are easy to use. These cars are so dependable and maintenance costs are reasonable. I have never taken my Infiniti to a mechanic for repairs and been shocked by the cost of the repair. This car has been a pleasure to own. what's not to like about this car?

Review:  I bought this car new as the first G35 was coming out and Infiniti was phasing out the i series and the lot had the last five to choose from.  This car had a lot of luxury for the money!  I was skeptical about rear wheel drive car in winter of the G's and the G had a much smaller cabin and fewer standard features.   No regrets!  Very speedy off the line if you jump on it, We get 28/29 mpg on highway, 20 commuting around town. Comfortable over over long distances, huge trunk. Now have 74,000 miles on it, out of warranty and worried about major repairs.  Looking to trade it in while I can still get $10k for it

Title: Exceptional Value! Best Used Car To Buy!
Review:  I had recently come into a decent job and I was looking for a car to replace my 93 Pontiac Grand Prix. I found a Black 2004 w/ 101,000 I35 for 6300$. I fell in love with the car immediately, the first driving experience I had with a real car. It handles very well, drove on ice the couple times I drove, and was just shocked at how well Infiniti does with building their cars. Everyone gets to drive these cars up to 150,000 miles+. I had every intention of doing this. Unfortunately I was stopped at a red light and a kid on his phone hit me going 50 mph. Again, the car did very well and all I got was a sore couple of weeks. I would encourage anyone looking for a used car research and purchase.

The ride is so smooth, the comfort is amazing, and the features never stop pleasing. I regularly drive from New Haven, CT to Boston, MA, (about 2 hours) and I never get bored or get stiff. The climate control kicks in immediatly from cold to hot or vice versa. It accelerates quickly even at highway speeds. There is a huge trunk and plenty of rear space for normal sized people. I cannot stress enough how pleasing this car is. Go to a dealership and take one out overnight, and you will understand what I am talking about.

Review:  I purchased this car, my 3rd Infiniti, to get one of the last front drive models because I live in snow country. Compared to my 1997 I30, this car has better seats, more power and sharper handling with the 17 inch wheels. There's only one glitch so far - an irritating rattle in the dash when going over expansion strips or sharp bumps. Other than that it's clear that Infiniti seriously believes in the concept of continuous improvement. For the same money as my '97, I have a much more substantial car with more features, better quality, better safety and some serious grunt off the line. Plus you can count on it being reliable - and reliability is the truest luxury of all. This is a good car.

I did have fun with it, although it was way underpowered ( I thought I was gonna die going up huge hills.) But then When i was trying to switch lane (with those horrible blind spots) it took me a little too long to make sure it was clear and I ended up REAR ENDING A CAR! THEN THE CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE INSTANTLY AND INCINERATED EVERYTHING WITHIN MINUTES AS IF SOMEONE USED A FLAMETHROWER ON IT FOR 15 MINUTES STRAIGHT. I don't even know what to think of this vehicle.

Title: Great Truck But Check Transmission!
Review:  This has been a great truck for us. The only thing about this truck is the transmission oil has no dipstick. You cannot check the fluid level or color from the under the hood, the truck has to be on a lift. So when we bought it used, about 3 months later the transmission started to jerk and we took it in to get serviced. It had about 55,000 miles on it and the mechanic told us the transmission had never been serviced and needed to be replaced. Of course he was a crook so we took it someplace else. They made repairs on it that cost around $500 so we got away pretty lucky. No problems since and it has been a great car. Just make sure to get the transmission checked out before you buy used!

For those debating it, I    definitely recommend buying the V6    engine. Changing lanes takes getting    used to (the blind spots are    horrendous,) and with the spare tire and    rear-seat headrests where they are,    reverse is worse. But those are its only    drawbacks - keep them in mind when you    test drive it. I've been very pleased.

Review:  My '99 XK8 convertible is my dream car, after 40 years of Jags, BMWs, Mercedes, etc. The key to happy motoring with these cars is 1) inform yourself about the issues, mainly the 4.0 liter's needs re upgraded timing chains, tensioners & water pump, and 2) have a local Jaguar specialist (not dealer) who can bring them up to standard & maintain them there. My XK8 cost me $5800 in 2015 with perfect body & interior, no accidents and with the engine upgrades already done & convertible top hydraulic lines replaced. After new tires, shocks, motor mounts, front brakes, mass airflow meter, valve cover gaskets, plugs & filters, she now runs & drives like new for a total all-in price of around $11k. I couldn't be happier.UPDATE: 15 months into ownership of my '99, I've spent very little on the car except for oil & gas. Classic/specialty auto insurance (Hagerty) has reduced the cost of comprehensive insurance to less than $400 annually on an agreed value of $15k. Costs since the initial review have been limited to a new Jaguar ignition coil ($128) & professionally repainting the front & rear bumpers (approx. $600), a project I intended since purchase. There have been no other costs; everything works great on the car & it runs & drives beautifully. I still marvel at how much car you get with the XK8, compared with much more expensive GTs like an Aston Martin DB7 or (especially now) Porsche 911. It took nearly 20 years for the XK8's predecessor, the XJS, to begin to appreciate in value, so it will be awhile before XK8 values start climbing. In the meantime, buy the best accident-free XK8 you can afford, have a local Jaguar specialist maintain/service it, and take care of it like it deserves. Great value, great motoring, great experience.UPDATE (5/16/17): 30 months in & still loving my XK8 - she's a keeper. A few months ago, I decided to fix some miscellaneous leaks (oil, coolant), a part of owning any British car. My local Jag specialist replaced the coolant bypass hose, water distribution pipe & thermostat housing, plus some o-rings & the coolant cap. The shop also replaced the oil pan gasket & drain plug. The fixes weren't cheap but they worked. Costs: parts ($321.32) & labor ($284.20) totaled $624.80 w. tax. The car is now approaching 130k mi. & drives as sweet as ever. I'm planning some road trips for the summer, including a couple of British car shows. The body & paint is excellent, the black leather interior has that aromatic richness of Connolly leather that I love, and the power top, AC & electricals all work perfectly. It's still a few more years before XK8s start their upswing in value as a modern classic, so find a good 'un now while they're cheap & enjoy!UPDATE (5/17/18): Quick update on my XK8 after 3+ years of ownership - she still looks great, comes out of the garage on sunny days, and runs like a top. No issues at all during the last year - I've added about 2000 miles since the last update. Hard to believe my XK8 is approaching 20 years old, but it's true. I sometimes get a yen to sell it & get something else, but what would take its place? A drive in the country, top up or down, is all it takes to remind me what a great car it really is. She's a keeper.

Title: Stay away
Review:  After 80,000 miles, the timing chains came off.  The engine was destroyed. And the warranty had expired.  Jaguar must have known about this issue -- the issue has been widely written about by other owners on the internet and my dealership stated that chains typically come loose between 80,000 and 100,000 (but a small oil leak usually leads to a repair before all timing chains come off).  But no one warned me.  Not Jaguar, and not my dealership.  Don't be a fool.  Don't buy junk.

Title: So-So car
Review:  I traded a 98 Porsche Boxster for a 99 Jaguar XK8 a few years ago.son I did it was to have a back seat for my kids to ride.Unfortunately the back seat is so small only kids under 5 can fit.Exterior:No complaints. It's a sleek, nice design. Interior:Extremely difficult to enter/exit but once inside is comfortable .The wood interior is nice but the rest is cheap, easily breakable plastic.Mechanical:The well-known cheaply-made plastic timing chain tensioners should have been replaced on all the XK under warranty. Overall by no means a luxury car. Then again, I'm comparing it to an LS Lexus.

Title: Great value, but requires some patience....
Review:  As someone who has owned two other Jaguars, an XJ6 and an XJ8, that were purchased new and kept for 7 or more years and 100k miles, without any problems, I was optimistic that my purchase of a 1999 XK8 in the spring of 2010 would not present any problems.I researched the car and was aware of the timing chain issue (which I replaced immediately on purchase of the car), but I was unprepared for mysterious "check engine" light problems.After several unsuccessful attempts by my repair shop the problem ultimately was the electronic throttle control module (a very expensive part).After replacing the ECM - no problems.All in all still a lot of car for the money!

Title: Worth the headaches
Review:  Bought this gem used with 21K miles on it. Good thing I had an extended warranty. Plenty of electrical problem, traction control fail, antilock brake fail, convertible top lines fractured (not covered), fuel pump fail, starter fail, etc. In spite of all that, this car is just fab. It drives like a dream now that everything is fixed. She is a thing of beauty. I never get tired of starting the engine. She handles so well on the road and is great on the highway (gets 26 mpg believe it or not). These cars have lots of computer glitches. You have to get used to them. Thing you need most is a mechanic you trust who can keep your gem running smoothly. Dealerships are not always the best at this.

Review:  I just bought my Jag Xk8 convertible a few months ago. It is black on black with chrome wheels. The car gets plenty of looks. People cannot tell what year or what I paid for this baby. The car is beautiful to look at in motion or while sitting still. Under the hood is a monster. the car has power the run a quarter mile when needed. In short, just buy it. You treat the car good, and she'll treat you real nice.

Title: Mixed feelings
Review:  I love the looks and the ride is exceptional for a sports car.  Long trips are no problem, the car is easy to drive and very responsive on the highway.  It could use more low end torch, and the transmission is a concern sense it is a closed system, unable to change any fluids.  I had to change motor mounts and the safety monitoring system for the transmission is very touchy.  The vehicle brakes very well and stability is exceptional.

Title: A great old girl
Review:  I have a friend who owned this car and was moving out of the country and couldn't take it.  I have been salivating over it for some time, so buying it was a no-brainer.  I haven't owned a convertible before, so it has been a delight driving around topless this summer.  The interior is comfortable, but those back seats are a bit silly.   The acceleration is good and the hum of the engine is delightful.  I've had quite a few people ask me about the car at stoplights and stop signs.  What a fun car to drive.

Review:  Great looking but no real substance.  At 65000 miles, I have repaired timing chain guides, motor mounts, tilt wheel electronics, door lock electronics, memory seat electronics, Mass Air flow meter, throttle body module, fuel pump, fuel regulator, plugs and it still is a big question mark.  Can shut down in traffic.  No notice.  Can be hard to start up with shaking for 2 minutes.  Shows failures but the computer reads unrelated problems which if fixed would not make any difference.  Intermittent ability to start up.  Sometimes seems like no starter connected.

Title: The Brits can still make a great car
Review:  I had resisted buying another Jaguar since my bad experiences with the XJ models of the 70/80s. However, since Ford has dragged this famous marque into the 21st century, with good quality control & finish, I decided to give the make another go. I have not regretted it for one moment, because this beautiful lady will make you feel 20 years younger without surgery & hours in the gym  (as did XKE in the 1960s). The performance & endless  power is captivating (forget the nonsense of 0-60 & top speed).The ride is firm, but comfortable & the road holding is like a go-kart. The design team of Jaguar has blended luxury, style, performance & feel good factor in one car, which is hard to beat under $100K.

Title: Great Car for the Money
Review:  When I say money, I don't mean original sticker price, but rather the purchase price of one that is a few years old. Prices drop like a rock on both the XJs and the XKs. The other XJs that I've owned (95' and up) have been dead reliable (one with 186k miles) and we are hoping that the same can be said of this XK, since they share a lot of parts. Much better built car than my Porsche 968 and mostly just as much fun, even without a manual transmission. Old XJS platform has some cowl shake, but it's pretty much kept under control. It's a very nice car to drive to work everyday or take on weekend trips. Luggage space, mileage and noise isolation are decent for a convertible.

Review:  Overall good car. It's a kick to drive and it looks great. Put Pirelli tires on it and it really handles. Car was reliable until about 75,000 miles. After that, transmission and instrument pack had to be replaced. Car also jumped timing and timing chain needed to be repaired. Premature in my book. Make sure you purchase the extended warranty. It's worth its weight in gold!

Review:  It is a fun car to drive I even had a  police officer stop me to admire the  car, honestly no ticket. I had the  engine replaced at 34,000 miles because  of no oil. I don't know if the  servicing dealer didn't put in enough  or why or how it lost it. It was  covered under warranty after a fight  with Jag reps. What I did find out is  the gauges are not reliable because  prior to dying, the engine temp and oil  pressure guages all said normal nor  were there any red lights lite on the  dash.

Title: Crossing My Fingers
Review:  So, I just bought my first used car.  It's a 1999 Jeep Cherokee.  I've read Kelley's Blue Book, and the price was right on target.  It has 179,000 miles on it.  Jeep owners tell me it will still go on and on.  I've also read most of these reviews, and they all seem very positive. .The man who sold it told me it just needs a muffler; it is a bit loud.  Other than that, it rode well.  One owner.  It's my first Jeep, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I'll be very happy if I can get at least a year out of it and, hopefully, not spend too much money on it for repairs.  But time will tell.

Title: awesome vehicle
Review:  We bought this 99 cherokee inline 6 back in 2004 with 70,000 miles.  Over the years the biggest repair that was needed was the rear main seal replacement at 280,000 miles.  Other than that it has been the usual replacement of parts that will eventually wear out with time. The engine has never been stripped down to do an overhaul or replace anything, besides spark plugs and the like.  Now at 305,000 miles the engine still sounds the same from when we bought it. The mpg reads 15 but i tested this and found that it is getting 21 in the city. Awesome. Oil change every 3000 miles and other regular maintenance and I believe this engine will go to 400,000 without an overhaul.  People complain about the ride being crappy which is correct, but then you don't buy a jeep for comfort.  This vehicle is a true utility truck. And it actually handles quite well in the city.  Jeep designed a great truck with the cherokee and plan on keeping this going for as long as I can. Eventually will restore this back to factory look and feel.

Title: Longest Relationship To Date
Review:  I bought my 1999 Jeep Cherokee, 2WD, 6 cyl, automatic, 4-door from my employer in 2003. It was about to roll over to 100,000 miles, and they wanted to get rid of it. I paid $2500.00 broken into 4 payments. I continued to use it for work travel which was sometimes brutal temps and environments. Whenever I got my per-diem pay for using my Jeep, I would take her into Pep Boys, NLR, AR and give her whatever she needed. In 2015, she rolled over the 200,000 mark. The last 10 years I have cut way back on driving, and have not had the money to put into her care and maintenance, but she has always been true and faithful. The repairs have been few, and the cost of owning her has been a dream. I am recently at the point where I could buy a new car, but instead; I am going to have her completely restored. As I have had many mechanics tell me over the years, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Maybe I am too emotionally attached, but this Jeep has been everything I needed.

Review:  This car was a hand me down from my aunt. She and my uncle take very good care of their cars, so don't give me the whole "you must not have taken care of it" thing. This car has been nothing but problems. Endless electrical problems is the first issue. In less than a year that I've had this car, the automatic door locks, cruise control, trunk light, horn, airbag, and the windows have all stopped working. I've had several mechanic friends check all of the fuses and everything and they are all completely fine. I haven't taken it in yet cause I can't afford the huge costs. On top of all of that it has completely broken down twice AGAIN in just a year of having it. All in all just a huge pain.

Review:  Let me just start off by saying I love my JEEP! And there is no denying it this baby is a Jeep. Some people think the only real Jeeps are Wranglers but that's not the case, this bad boy even stock has the capability to do some pretty amazing things off road. The best part about this jeep is that while being able to take it for a fun weekend camping or 4x4ing is nice and easy its also a great car to drive on the road,in the city or on the highway. I have a 99 cherokee sport in automatic (not listed on this site if im not mistaken) and she has over 230,000 miles with nearly no major repairs aside from a starter and a new ac pump. And of course some body damage fixes but that' my fault not hers

Review:  I bought this car from my uncle at 127,000 miles. This thing is a beast. iv driven it to 182,000 miles and iv only had 2 problems. i had to replace the water pump and the rear O2 sensor. both cheap to buy and relatively easy to repair you self. i have never had a starting problem, well when its -30 out side in the morning she doesn't want to start, but she always starts. and people who complain about the drivetrain i have never had a problem, probably because i changed both rear and front differential fluid along with the transfer case fluid at about 160,000 miles, AND, i regular grease the drive shafts. All of theses are very easy to do and can significantly increase the live of a jeep.

Review:  After buying my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 3DR new, I proceeded to log over 168k miles in it until 2012. No power windows, roof rack or fancy bells or whistles. I just sold it last month. Most of my milage was city/hwy driving. I averaged 17/22 MPG. Not too bad with an air conditioner. The off roading in the snow was as impressive as a Jeep commercial can leagaly put on the TV. My service record shows normal maintenance. I needed to replace the clutch at around 90K and the air conditioner was replaced at 120k. The only real problem was a clutch sensor that kept burnig out 15A fuses in the fuse box. The sensor was replaced and it ran well ever since. I liked it so much I purchsed another Jeep.

Review:  This thing is a tank. Parents bought it new in '99, never had a major problem with it. The engine is rock solid. 190K miles on it and going strong as when it was new. Never had any leaks or any problems at all. Have replaced some parts outside of wear parts (rear springs, U-joints, front stabilizer shock), but this thing is tougher than nails. With new shocks and rear springs, rides better than my sports car. Even ran into a tree two years ago, had it fixed, and you could never tell anything ever happened to it. We expect to keep this Jeep at least another 100K miles. We live off three miles of rough dirt road and it takes the punishment and asks for more. Best vehicle we've ever owned.

Title: Undervalued, in my opinion.
Review:  First car. Had it for six years until it was rear ended. Literally drove it from coast to coast with no problems. Smooth response at lower speeds with just enough torque on the highway to get you around a semi in a hurry. Handling was great around town. Good turning radius. Bumpy ride. Passengers don't enjoy it much. Backseat kinda cramped. But from the driver's seat it's not a problem. Front shocks went out along with water pump and compressor after a few years. Other than that, the engine never gave me any problems, even with my terrible upkeep. Engine was abused with stop and go driving in 100 degree heat with few oil changes the whole time I drove it. Held up great.

Review:  I bought my jeep as a college sophomore back in 2005.  Purchased in New York where I'm from, and attending school in Savannah, GA, I knew I was in for some serious mileage.  I did my research and found a great Cherokee.  That car has been up and down the east coast at least 10 times, been in rough road in the swamps of the deep south, and it never died.  There were a few minor electrical problems, along with no CD player, however it was perfect.  I just sold it (and miss it so much!) due to another long trip across the country, but will probably buy a jeep again.

Tough little SUV that does everything you want it to. Never complains when I hit those huge New England pot holes and you can drive it in any weather you want. Taken it out in white-out snow storms in a foot of powder and it does excellent. Never crossed my mind that I'd get stuck in any condition. Not the most comfy/efficient car but its a tough little SUV that rides stiff and never complains. Great for someone looking for a tough reliable truck that will take you anywhere and won't complain about a little tough drivin

Review:  I bought my Jeep in Dec, 08 it rides very good in bad weather conditions, but the previous owner must have went off roading with it, cause the ride was very rough, replace shocks and struts an that helped alot, it had 110,000 on it an now has 123,000 been having electrical issues as of late, this is a suv that I wouldn't hesitate to buy brand new, am looking to upgrade to a 2001 with less wear an tear! Gas mileage isn't a problem as has been reported by other buyers!

Review:  I got my Jeep Cherokee when I turned 16, and it was a former border patrol unit so it had a few modifications to its factory build. It came with skid plates and yaddi yadda...

Title: Die hard Jeep fan
Review:  Absolutely love my Jeep, I bought it from the construction co that I work for when it was 3 years old & the lease was up.  Had 60K miles on it then.  Has 185,000 now, March 09.  rarely had problems with it.  It's been all over the beaches of NC & VA & thru the snow in PA.  handled well in every situation.  Other than changing belts when they get worn, and changing the oil faithfully, I don't normally put any money in it.  I have had to replace a window motor & brakes once, but that's really about it.  My daughter will be 16 in a year & I plan on handing this reliable car down to her.  & she can't wait!!  I wish there was another Jeep I liked as much as this one that I could replace it with.

Title: ok
Review:  My parents bought my 99 Cherokee sport in 2000, drove it for about 5 years, and then handed it down to me. It now has 140,0000 miles on it. I have no complaints about how it runs, never had any problems with that. However, the ac has stopped working, the front speakers blew out, the rear windshield wiper doesn't work, and the handle that pops that hood was so sticky, that mechanics changing the oil completely pulled it off and now the hood won't latch and I have to put a ratchet strap around it to keep it down. It gets me from place to place, but that's about it.

Title: Love my  Jeep
Review:  I bought my black Cherokee Sport 4x4 off the showroom floor. It had a whole 9 miles on it. It currently has almost 130k on it. It has only been in the shop once, for a loose torque converter. It has always gotten 19 MPG with good gas. The engine set up makes preventative maintenance easy. Even the transmission pan has a drain plug. The I-6 is essentially a tractor motor. You can't kill a tractor and you can't kill a Jeep. Maybe they should have provided a PTO, that would've been handy. I still can't believe they quit making these great vehicles. I'll run mine until the wheels fall off.

Title: Ride or Die Vehicle
Review:  I absolutely could not live without my Cherokee. I've had it for 11 years. Bought it with 13,000 miles on it. It's been in four accidents (1 while parked), extensive road trips throughout upstate NY during my sorority days, and survived NYC potholes. Within the past two years, I've had to change the brake pads, thermometer, radiator, steering box, battery and have multiple electrical problems resulting in shortages in the front and rear lights. Overall, she has lasted me well as hard as I drive, and I'm looking for another vehicle as equally reliable.

Title: Love My Jeep
Review:  I bought this car car new. It has been reliable. 187000 miles now. Never had an issue with the transmission. Awesome offroad, and snow performance - never been stuck in mud or snow.  Part time 4x4 is great. 17 mpg average. Got 21 mpg once on highway trip. Replaced normal things- alternator, belt, brakes, tires. Stuck with regular maintenance. Replaced several window motors, and has had several electrical glitches.Recently had head gasket replaced (approx. $800) due to oil leak - first leak I've had.  Now evaporator coil is cracked ($1300 repair, or no AC). It may be getting close to time to replace, but I really don't want to get rid of it. With new tires, it's impossible to surpass off road

Title: There's no replacement for Cherokee
Review:  Bought this very basic 4x4 last summer with 125k on the clock, and just grow more enthusiastic every day. Its not a luxury car, but is very tractable on-road and there is NO vehicle still in production in 2008 that can come anywhere close to matching it for balancing on-road manners and sheer offroad capability. Its also built like a tank and is unbelievably reliable. Important stuff just does not fail on this car. Fuel econ. is quite good in commuting. They're so common that they're almost forgotten- but just look around you in traffic some day and start counting, and note how many still look great. Then remember there hasn't been a new one built for 7 years. Take THAT, Toyota.

Title: Jeep Trifecta
Review:  Bought this new in 99 and we love it.   This was to replace my car and after test drives of others kept coming back to the Cherokee, we had bought a used 90 Cherokee in 91 that my husband used for work. When we decided to replace the 90 my husband went looking for another and we now have a 2000 Sport Cherokee. These are all going strong and shouldn't need to replace for years.  The 99 gets the most mileage now as I have to travel for my job but at 130K it should last until retirement. The 90 still gets lots of use at the beach, when the kids need there cars fixed, still going strong. Bring them back Jeep, there is nothing quite like this SUV.

Title: My First Car
Review:  I bought my red, 5-speed Jeep Cherokee in Sept. 2006 and still have it to this date. I bought it with 85k miles on it and it now has a little more than 100k miles on it. In that time, the only problems I've had are glitchy power windows and a cracked evaporator. I was slightly weary about buying a gas guzzling SUV for my first car but after driving it for a while, I've found that it does real well. It gets about 19/20 city, but I find that keeping it just below 65 on the highway will get me 30 mpg for highway trips (and that's with a fully loaded college vehicle!). This has been and will remain a fun, reliable, and efficient first vehicle. I plan to hold onto this for a long time.

Title: 99 Sport
Review:  Always wanted a Cherokee since the early '90s.  Bought new in '99.  Goes just about anywhere you want.  Only problem was with the front windows. Both driver and passenger motor brackets broke within a year of each other and caused the window to drop to the bottom of the door. I pull a 2000 lb camper all over the Tennessee hills at 80 with no problems.  Easy to work on or modify with uncountable parts available for greater off road performance.  Limited only by your imagination. It is truly a shame that Jeep stopped making the Cherokee.  Nothing else can compare.

The L6 pulls my trailer and 2 atv's with no problems (sportsman 500,600).  The fuel is decent for something like this.  The auto trans is bullet proof.  They should never have stopped building these.  My only complaint is the power windows.  The sport is the most expensive to replace as it is a dealer only item.

I am a professional guide & retired law man, & I go where a goat should not. The only thing I would like is better fuel mileage on the highway. It has the 4 ltr./auto trans. Great vehicle, for what it was made for. Have tried many others, including imports. They cannot stay close in the off road situations. Requires more than normal maintenance, but that is the price you pay

Review:  I bought my Jeep when it only had 3 miles on it. I saw the truck driver when he was backing it off the delivery truck. It was Chili Pepper Red with Grey inside. I bought the extended warranty for 7 years or 100,000 miles. (DID NOT USE IT) The only problem that I have had is that the alternator went out at about 75,000 miles. I change the oil every 3500 mi and have a regular maintenance schedule. This Jeep looks as good as it drives.

I meet people all the time who tell me they are the best vehicle ever, and who have very high mileage. I use it on very, very bad "roads" in the hills of backwoods East Tennessee and also to commute and to haul electronic equipment. This Jeep does it all.

Title: Why did Jeep stop making these?
Review:  I bought my Jeep from the original owner in June of 2006, and I've been very happy since day 1. I bought it with 75k, and since then i've put 23K on it since. I've had to replace the orginal brakes on it (i'd suggest the ceramic brake pads), tires, and shocks, but that's been it. I also put a 2" lift kit on it, because stock 4x4 vehicles tower over it. Now it's about the height of a stock 4-runner. The best thing is that it's never stranded me, it's been the best car I've owned and I've owned and sold a lot cars.

Title: Nothing Can Replace It!
Review:  I have had my Jeep since my junior year of high school.  It got me to and from college countless times, three moves, and even an annual 1,000 mile round trip vacation.  This car has never broken down and I have never needed roadside assistance in the 8 years I have owned it. However, AC finked out at 90,000 and many minor repairs were also made, adding up quite a bit.  But I can't complain, this car is the epitome of reliable- snow storms, white outs, blinding rain? No problem, always has got me through! The design has no bells and whistles, mine doesn't even have cruise control, but thats's what makes this car fun!  It's a truck and meant to be simple.

Review:  I owned my Cherokee for 4 1/2 years. It was a great vehicle. The V6 is capable and the 4 wheel drive is awesome. The truck got me through any type of condition with no problems. Overall reliability was great. The only items that I replaced (outside of normal maintenance items like brakes and tires) were a steering linkage piece and a power window part. Other than that, the vehicle was free of problems. If they still made them I would buy another. Since they don't I bought the new Patriot which is the most similar thing Jeep now makes.

Review:  This is my second Cherokee (the first was a 96), and I've really enjoyed the restyle (done in 97).  I get good fuel economy with the 5-speed manual, and the 4wd works well in the snow.  Never breaks, but when it does it's inexpensive to repair and easy to do-it-yourself.  An excellent all around SUV.  It isn't the newest design or the most stylish, but I think it's the best.  Jeep never should have killed it for the Liberty.

Title: hmmm...
Review:  I bought my Jeep with 66k miles on it. It is now 9 months later and I have put 3k miles on it. My Cherokee is a lemon! I purchased the extended warranty which would cover it fully until 2009 or 100k. I have had to bring it in to be serviced 6 times and only 2 were covered under warranty! Thankfully the REALLY expensive fixes were covered under warranty: driveshaft and transfer case cracking which would have set me back thousands of dollars. Three times the check engine light came on with the dealer telling me that the vapor canister was cracked, the gas tank was cracked, and some issue with my transmission. The other was when the crankshaft broke causing me to be stranded!

Title: Best Value Hybrid
Review:  Bought 2017 Optima Hybrid in November 17. It was the only Hybrid Optima on the lot out of dozens of gas ones. I had been comparing Accord, Camry, and Malibu Hybrids and read the Optima Hybrid got 46 mpg on the hwy. That was only 2 or 3 miles per gallon less than the best of them so I did some pricing. My choice was for the 26,800 premium with pretty standard features, good radio with Android Audio and SiriusXM, dual zone climate control, tilt, cruise control,pwr    windows and Door locks. At the time of purchase, there was a $5,000 rebate offered. I could not believe it. All this car for less than a Prius prime.  I have driven it to over 18k miles in 6 months after taking several trips and I really enjoy and appreciate this car. My first trip was from Phoenix to Vegas. Did it on one tank of gas. The car went 828 miles. Very impressive! Really like having a 6 speed transmission instead of a CVT. Driven properly there are days when it averages 60 to 61 mpg city hwy mix. It can go up to 80mph in electric mode. 10 year 100 k warranty and a 5star safety rating I think the value is unbeatable.

This car met all my expectations: stylish, smooth/quiet/comfortable interior, reasonable EV range. It did deliver the 29 all EV range as advertised. I've installed a 240V outlet and used an inexpensive level 2 charger I bought from Amazon.com for less than $250, it charged the car from empty to full battery in less than 3 hours.  Well done KIA!

Title: Glad I only got the two year lease...
Review:  Maybe it's just my car - and I know it has JD Power initial quality award for the segment - but I'm having a few issues that started when I initially got the car.  The door rattles, the dashboard makes noises in the heat - occasionally the temperature gauge starts out showing an exterior temp of 32 degrees even when it's well over 70, and sometimes the rear camera stays on ten second past pushing the car out of reverse into drive.  The car handles ok, acceleration is poor though.  Excellent use of space and nice panoramic roof...  No SMS notifications in infotainment system which my last two cars had...  This is my first Kia, and I'm disappointed - it will be my last - like I said before I was debating between a 2 and 3 year lease - I'm glad I went with the two year.

Title: Gotta Have A Cadenza!!!!!
Review:  As my lease on my 2015 Chevy Malibu was almost up, I started car shopping and I HATE car salesmen.  I looked at several cars including buying a Malibu, Sonata, Cadillac and more, and I had a salesmen suggest I drive a  new 2017 Cadenza, which I did.  I am glad that I listed to him.  I loved the ride, but I was not going to pay $46K for the top of the line model.  The lease deal they had seemed great, but at the end of the day, it was still way too expensive.  I knew I wanted a 2017 Limited and preferably white.  I found a 2017 used (8200 miles) exactly like I wanted and I saved almost $17k from what it would have cost new.  I LOVE THIS CAR.  The ride is great, the looks are great and where I was concerned about my gas mileage (the Malibu averaged about 26 mpg around town and I got 32 mpg on the highway), this Cadenza is right there even though it's rated for only 20-28.  I drive it like there is an egg under my accelerator and once I get it up to speed, I just hold the gas pedal in place, I don't have to keep feeding it like I did on my Malibu.  On a recent highway trip I averaged 37 MPG (YES 37 MPG) and I am getting about 26 mpg around town.  What more could a buyer ask for?   Great Deal!!  Great Looking car!!!   Great MPG!!!  If you are looking for a nice upscale luxury type sedan, you need to look at the Cadenza.  I would highly suggest trying to find a used one and save yourself mega $$$$$.

Title: Surprisingly Great Tech Package update
Review:  I have owned BMW Convertible, 5 Series M Sport, Acura TSX & many Toyota's & Honda's. The 2017 Cadenza is the most comfortable car I have ever owned. Full of High Tech in Tech package. Smooth ride, excellent seats (better than Volvo).August 2018 updateTo date this is the best car I have ever owned.  No repairs in 1st year and 21,000 miles. No adjustments of any sort. By comparison my BMW’s needed 3-6 in first year. Tread life on tires is good but tires are too noisy once broken in. Seats are superbly comfortable. Averaging 27 MPG with 50/50 split on highway vs city driving. List price for my car was just under $40000, got it out the door for under $33000. What a great car & what a bargain. Have only less than 10 of them on the road in last year. Nice!

Title: Surprisingly a nice car
Review:  I traded in a 2014 Chrysler 300 and purchased the 2015 premium with the technology and luxury packages with 15k miles.  I was looking at the Buick LaCrosse, Chevy Impala, Azara.  The car is just as roomy as the 300 and surprisingly drives much better.  The car with the 19 inch tires is very stiff, and you can feel the bumps as you drive.  The car is very comfortable to drive, i especially enjoy the option of the extended seat for the back of the legs on long trips.  i didnt think much about that until i used it and it was very comfortable.   As simple as this may be, the headlights on the car are very good, and you can see a good distance with them.  I find that the navigation and UVO system is very finicky and i am having trouble with the voice recognition (how does call home turn into call Paul?), maybe i just do not know how to use it yet, but i would think it would be self explanatory.   The car has very good acceleration for the V6, especially when you are at highway speeds.  I have the paddle shifters, but havent used them nor am i sure why they would be on this car, i cant see too many buyers of this car using them.  I am currently getting 25.5 mpg in normal mix driving of highway and city, so that was a surprise to me, was expecting less.                                                                            Overall the car is very good very comfortable, good gas mileage and very roomy.  all the controls are in easy to reach places and are easy to use. The ride is stiff on the 19 inches, but the handling is very good as well; not a sports car handling but very good.   there are a few things that are annoying 1) how does a car like this not come standard with a remote start 2) the universal remote buttons on the review mirror do not light up when the headlights are on 3) the car is lower to the ground than i expected vs some of the competition 4) this car with the 19 inch low profile wheels are HORRIBLE in the snow, you will need snow tires.  I would recommend this car

Title: Nice, BUT...
Review:  Car has power and is extremely quiet, however, transmission is not smooth, nav/electronics not very intuitive and set up of front seats for comfort is poor for long trips.  The AC is nice and operates well.  Also, backseat is roomy.  The absolute WORST part of owning this car vs every other car I've bought/leased is the dealerships.  I had problems with the two I dealt with on several levels.  Overall, performance is great, comfort is poor and would like easier-to-use electronics.

Acceleration is consistent with other cars in the category.  Handling is just ok, certainly not up to Audi A4 standards.   Interior is great, the roof is great.  I've had some problems with Kia Finance as well and recommend avoiding them, if possible.

Title: You don't drive a Cadenza? Shame on you!
Review:  Just purchased my 2nd Cadenza Limited. This is my 7th Kia since 2001. This is the perfect car for price, warranty,  options. You will pay a great deal more for same options on BMW, Lexus. Mercedes-Benz. Don't waste your money for the name and prestige of such. Test drive this car. You will purchase. Get the SX Limited. Excellent road car. Burn only premium fuel and you will get 30+ mpg on road trips. Over 500 miles on one tank of gas. Check out the 2017 Limited. Many added features and actually a slightly lower price. You just will not go wrong with any Kia but particularly with the Cadenza Limited. Test to drive it, you will buy it.

Title: Is it really a KIA?
Review:  I test drove the Cadillac CTS, the Lexus ES 350 and the Cadenza.  Absolutely love my Cadenza.  I've owned many new higher end GM and Toyota cars but have never enjoyed driving one as much as my Cadenza.  Apparently I'm not alone with my feelings as I am seeing more and more KIAs on the road.It is now 9 months later and I still love my Cadenza.My only additional comment about my Cadenza is that with the 19 wheels and a somewhat taut suspension, I feel that 18 inch wheels or higher profile tires would have been a better choice for more comfortable driving over some of the New England roads that are in disrepair.

Title: Mostly Good
Review:  I have about 2K miles on a 2015.   The Car looks nice, drives well and has good acceleration.   Pricing was good.   However buyers should know a couple of things:1.  These cars depreciate  pretty quickly.   Do you own comparison.  Suggest a lease2.   The handling is comfortable but not sportyMy one disappointment has been the built in GPS  which simply consistently make VERY strange routing systems.   The system allows you to pre-program selections such as "avoid tolls"  but it has just been horrible.   I am disappointed that i use Google on my smart phone for navigation although its not a huge deal.   Positives are the roof (cool), the look (nice...looks a lot like a Lexus) ,   the acceleration is good,  comfort is good. Very spacious.

I would say my only slightly negative comment is that I was surprised that the car does not have daytime running lights.  I didnt even think to ask because they are so prevalent on cars and most all other Kia's seem to have them. Otherwise, I would certainly recommend this car to anyone especially as a used purchase as they are a great value.

Title: No comparison!
Review:  I love cars. I love cars that are considered underdogs. I love cars that you don't see everyone driving. I love knowing that I have made a great deal and my car is worth every penny I spent. The cadenza is just that. An underdog that is better than its competition. No comparison. The impala, 300, Taurus etc. I owned two of the three competitors. Not that they are bad cars or alternatives. They just are not the best.  I drove the Toyota Avalon, bmw, Acura, and Lexus. For the price range the cadenza blows them away. Not to mention the styling and standard features! Kia comes with the 5 year warranty and 10 year powertrain and a specific premium service for it cadenza owners. I love that there isn't one every time I turn the corner. As a matter of fact KIA should be paying me to advertise. Lol. Every where I go people are always wondering what the car is and when I tell them a KiA they are instantly intrigued and ask me questions. its a beautiful car, quiet, handling, safety, and standard luxury features. Kia is in the rise and its quality is great. No recalls.  No repairs. No issues!! I haughty recommend.  They have hit this one out of the park. From what I hear from other Kia owners, it is the norm to have high quality and no recalls. They have made it into the luxury market and are moving forward quickly. I hear the K900 is also beautiful and hard to compete with, you won't be disappointed. Give Kia a try. You'll be impressed to say the least. Trust me.

Review:  Superb handling in a Beautiful Package.  Road Handling is a little stiff which reminds me of premium european sedans.  We now have 15K miles on our 2015 Cadenza and have no serious complaints and nothing has broken.  Additional sound attenuation would be appreciated but the noise level is better than most comparable vehicles.All in all Kia has hit it out of the ballpark with the Cadenza.  This may be the reason that virtually no dealer has any 2015 models remaining unsold.

Review:  I purchased my Cadenza Sept 2014. Overall, I'm very happy with my selection. I was certainly torn between choosing the Cadenza over the Chevy Impala. They were identical in terms of what I wanted in a fully loaded full size sedan, however the Cadenza had just more of that "it" factor I was looking for. There is no way possible I could get this much standard luxury at the price I paid in a BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Audi, etc.

Review:  This car is one of the nicest cars I have ever owned.  Spacious, hugs the road.....until....I was driving down the street and started to hear a loud clicking noise.  Towed it to the dealer and was told that the car needed a new engine!  I bought the car with 37k miles and the car was under 60k miles when this happened.  I had two oil changes on the car and was very careful with it.  THE KIA WARRANTY IS COMPLETELY HORSE****!  They will not honor it....but will come up with ways, at the cost of the owner, to suggest things that need to be done for the car....all so they can say it was your fault.  I will NEVER buy a KIA again just by the way they do business.  This was my only car and the financial setback to me was MAJOR!  NEVER AGAIN!

Title: Love this car
Review:  I was shopping for a Mercedes, or other top line car, and had never really considered a Kia.  I have been a loyal Toyota fan, and have owned multiple Avalons, but the current design of the Toyota models did not appeal to me.  This car had all the same features that other luxury models for less than half the price (I bought this car used).  With only 12K miles, it was as good as new, and I got a great bang for my buck, even though I paid additional for a long extended warranty.  I have owned the car for almost 9 months, and have no real complaints.  The one complaint I have is with the ventilated driver's seat, which on very hot days did not really cool.  Overall I am glad that I made this purchase.

Title: Good value but in the shop a lot
Review:  It's a great value however before my car even had 55,000 miles on the odometer I had the fuel sending unit and oxygen sensor replaced. The rack and pinion also failed all repaired under warranty. I wasn't expecting all these things with such low mileage. The car has never stopped running at all despite the problems. I had one issue where the entire car just died and needed a jump. The car turns head everywhere I go. I love the look and functions of the car. I think you'll love the car as if repairs do arise they are a lot cheaper than the other luxury brands. The car is excellent on the highway and very comfortable on long trips. I've enjoyed this car despite the few issues and I think you would too.

Title: Big Bob's Cadenza Review
Review:  I have owned or leased 5 Kias!  This includes an Amonte, three ( 3 ) Optimas, and the Cadenza I am reviewing.  The 2014 Cadenza I just traded in was one of the finest cars I have ever owned.  I never had one bit of trouble with it and it ran like a dream.  My ONLY criticism was getting in and out of the vehicle.  Because the car was low to the ground and I have a back that gives me trouble on occasion, it was a little bit of an effort to get in and out.  Once seated, I had no problems.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to ANYONE, and that includes luxury car owners.  I can make that statement, because I have owned Cadillacs, Lincolns and other high end vehicles.  My advice is simply this, if you can afford a Cadenza, buy it and you will not be disappointed.

Review:  Got the car as a dealer demo model with 15K miles.  I have put over 20k new miles on in 8 months.  My average mileage, city and road, is about 26mpg,  Love all the amenities and features.  The entertainment/info capability is great and works very well.  Easy Bluetooth connection. I did update the nav map info (about $180) that I thought was high.   Not thrilled with mileage of original Hankook tires.  I have to drive all over Colorado, so mountains and plains.  Got some Pirelli Sottozero 3 winter tires and they really allowed great traction even in blizzard conditions.  The bang for the buck is great, particularly as I got the car "used."   All who have ridden in it love the features.  Heated steering wheel has to be the favorite.  Paddle shifters for the mountains, with adaptive headlights really helps.  There aren't many out there, but it's absolutely a car to consider, if you need or want a more full sized sedan.  The value over euro sedans is tremendous.  Learn to love the name Kia.

Title: Complete Car for the Majority of People-UPDATE
Review:  UPDATE:  Bought the 2016 and couldn't be happier. Much nicer than the 14, Insurance rates dropped due to the additional safety equipment .You should shop and drive all the vehicles you have an interest in, investigate the cost of ownership, and the intangible pleasure factor of driving the car in as many situations as possible. Then and only then should the hesitant people should drive the Cadenza, with the comparative of your chosen vehicles, make an informed decision especially when you look at the cost to operate and buy plus the warranty. The answer is so apparent that Kia Cadenza is the right choice if those guidelines are important to you.I have never had anyone in my car that wasn't impressed and some ultimately bought a Cadenza. the ONLY issue I have had with my car is that upon starting after sitting for a short while, I get timing chain noise on startup. I have talked with other owners that do not have this issue and Kia is doing everything to fix the problem. When the 2016 Cadenza comes out I will most likely buy it, provided I can turn loose of my 14.UPDATE: Bought my 2016 Cadenza! Better actual gas mileage than my 2014 Cadenza with more safety features. Again totally happy with this car.

Title: The moron who left Toyota for the 2014 Cadenza
Review:  Don't get me wrong. I love the HD radio, the heated steering wheel along with the ride & handling. But so many little things have broken or gone wrong--the backup camera, the panoramic sunroof rattling which took 4 tries to fix, the volume control on the steering wheel broke, the sun visor tore, the seat belt stopped retracting, and the bluetooth is frustrating. I leased it thankfully because the value has crashed so to get out with 15 months to go would cost thousands out of pocket. If you love what you are driving don't experiment. Stick with the brand you know. I am now waiting for parts while driving a dodge loaner. It's nauseating. This wasn't the plan. The dealer tries it's best.

Review:  I own a 6 year old Kia Amanti and a new Kia Cadenza with the optional Luxury Package. I have enjoyed driving my Amanti long distances. It is quiet and a pleasure to drive. The Cadenza is Kias new luxury car since the Amanti was discontinued. Instead of a quiet ride, the Cadenza has horrible road noise. It sounds as if a window is always partly opened. I called Kia Customer Service (Kelly) to complain that a car branded as a luxury car should be first and foremost a quiet ride. I was told that essentially the car is the way it is supposed to be, that the road noise is my opinion and have a nice day.

Title: Very Good SUV
Review:  This is an execellent SUV, but you have to know what you are buying. This is not a large car, and it has quirks like all Landrover Vehicles I have had before. The most glaring positives are a very refined interior finish and quality. Very nice use of leather and other materials. On the outside styling is better than any other SUV on the road. The negatives are that the new flashy plastic panels used on the exterior are prone to scratching very easily and they should really be tougher. Even the car wash scratches them without the use of brushes. The tires are prone to quick replacement but have Porche type grip so no complaining here. Braking is excellent, better than any Range Rover before as well as gas mileage. Car, feels like it is supercharged. There is a need for improvement, the leather does not look like it will hold up like previous Range Rovers, and the car needs a bigger cargo area. Options add up quick and this SUV should come in under 49k with options in the next generation, as without doing so really makes the value proposition hard to support.  Note the car should be broken so that it is reliable. You can't drive very agressive for the first 1500 miles. The brakes and engine will not then be smooth.

Navigation is by far the worst I have ever seen. Oh yeah and the whole shutting down while you are driving on a major highway and locking up for no reason thing. I took it in for the same issue with wanting to stall since the first week I drive it off the lot. I was given the car back numerous times with the "We couldn't find anything" speel every single time. It has now been put back in the shop after the 5th or 6th time only now it completely shut off while driving. Then there's the random throwing itself into park and shutting down while trying to pull into my driveway as well. I can go on all day with what a piece of garbage this almost $50,000 vehicle is. The customer service is a joke as well. You will bring it in and won't see it sometimes for weeks. They will lie about not having a replacement vehicle for you to drive and whether you have an appointment or not you will spend a minimum of 4 hrs there. However if for some insane reason you do buy this joke of an suv, when you bring it in take a look around and watch how many cars get pulled up to service while you are there. Some with 13 miles on them not 13000 but 13!!! Too many to count came through and when speaking to the valet they said more cars in service than on the lot. So there ya go. I hope whoever is thinking about buying this pos looks at all the horrible reviews and goes to toyota and gets a real suv.

Title: Bluetooth Nightmare
Review:  I have had nothing but problems with the Bluetooth feature in this car! I have had the Evoque to the dealer more than once. I have also changed out my phone thinking it was the phone. The dealership told me they can't find anything wrong yet I have read all over the internet I am not alone. I do a large part of my business on the phone and this is truly unacceptable.

Title: Do not buy!!
Review:  I bought the Evoque in a bit of a hurry because we were moving to the mountains and I needed a four wheel drive. I am so sorry that I didn't do any research! I hope these reviews save someone else. We bought the Evoque used with 20,000 miles and a 50,000 warranty thank God. Long story short...at 36,000 miles it had to have front and rear brakes replaced, a new battery and then after I had had it home only ONE week I also had the gear box fault another reviewer mentioned.  It had to be towed!! Thankfully I was not in traffic like the other reviewer!! They said they can't get the part for a month, I still don't have it back. I am really in disbelief over the whole thing. I thought Land Rover was a good brand. I see them everywhere!!?? So if I ever get it back, I am getting rid of it right away of course and at a BIG LOSS!

Title: A Ford Escape wearing a dinner jacket.
Review:  All looks and no actions. A brand that I always admired Land Rover. My dream SUV turned out to be my worst nightmare and biggest disappointment in the automobile industry. As an avid car fanatic. I've had the pleasure of owning and leasing most of the high end vehicles in the market. From Mercedes Benz to BMW to Lexus both in sedans and SUV's. Until I decided that I was able and comfortable enough to finally afford my first Land Rover product. The 2015 Range Rover Evoque Pure Plus (5door). Well, my biggest mistake. I purchased the entity on 2/26/2015 as a Certified Pre Owned with barely 17K miles on the odometer. The vehicle looked show room condition inside, outside and under the hood. Rich leather scent inside gorgeous full glass roof and one of the most impressive infotainment systems I've ever seen. After driving it home and four days into my purchase I decided to google reliability of said vehicle and under Consumer Reports all reviews were one star and the horror stories were too much to mention from all over the world from the UK to Minnesota all over the US. People just devastated with their experiences A TRUE CAR BUYERS NIGHTMARE. Everything from engine stallings to sudden braking at high speeds causing driver and passengers injuries. To constant Check Engine lights and other notifications of malfunctioning all over the cluster. Repeated visits to the dealership days and weeks without their cars then getting back and the next day the same issues arising and the worst thing was the treatments by the dealer's disconcerting attitude. To the point they said to a particular owner. WELL WE CANT DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOU .... CONTACT LAND ROVER. After coming across this unexpected and disappointing horror stories I decided to return the Evoque just today 3/2/2016 on the fifth day and I was fortunate enough that the dealership has a FIVE DAY Return/Cancel or Exchange Policy. So I got my 2014 Mercedes Benz E350 back (Luckily again it had not been sold yet) got my title back and PUSHED THE PEDAL TO THE MEDAL. Like a bat outta hell I rushed home. I was one of the lucky ones. Shame on you LAND ROVER and JAGUAR brand. You're selling RATS WRAPPED IN MINKS. Disappointed.

Title: Hands Down Safest SUV
Review:  I leased a 2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque (Pure plus with options) in February 2015. It had some software issues during the first month (key was locked inside vehicle so that was an issue that needed to be addressed early on) but the dealership was very accommodating. I never had an issue with the Evoque after that. I do find that a bigger engine would be better because it is a big sluggish to take off. It handled the road very well and it was a very smooth ride as well. It had very good gas mileage especially on long drives. Entertainment system is great!****The most important thing that I will tell you is that 2 weeks ago, this truck was involved in a rollover accident and it was considered a total loss. Injuries to myself and the driver were very minimal as we walked away from the scene with minor injuries (cuts and scratches). For that very reason, I am going to get another one. I deem this to be a very safe vehicle. Don't take for granted the safety features in the truck. They work!

Title: I expected so much more!
Review:  First the good:  This is a great looking car and there are so few on the road I feel special driving it.  Also, it handles quite well in snow and ice.The bad:  It's small, you can't close the trunk from the inside of the car, the navigation system is horrible (I've been routed to dead ends more times than I care to recall), the front seats have no lumbar support, the rear window is way too small and the transmission is jerky.  The front console is too small and there are too many controls on the steering wheel that could adversely affect driving.  The ugly:  New front and rear brakes and tires required after only 25k miles!   Cost of routine maintenance is ridiculous, and the excessive number of software updates required is unheard of and take FOREVER. Unless you like spending time at the service center and wasting money, move on to something else.

Title: Unreliable Slug
Review:  I purchased my Evoque new in February 2015.  Since the vehicle was purchased it has had a software update (at 1200 miles) for the transmission to improve performance.  Then the check engine light came on at approximately 2K miles.  Turned out to be a faulty sensor that took several days to repair, due to part being unavailable.  On August 1st, while in traffic the transmission froze up and the vehicle rapidly decelerated with the dashboard warning indicating "Gear Box Failure", resulting in the vehicle being towed.  Land Rover corporate claims they have since resolved the problem with another software update, however I have not had the opportunity to drive the car yet-33 days later.  While the dealership was addressing another issue- freeze up problem with the touch screen interface; the computer module blew out.  After 33 days the part has finally come in.  The transmission on this vehicle is very sluggish in the lower gears, and power is very limited from a stop position, which makes pulling out into traffic a challenge.  I really would love to recommend this vehicle, but the amount of problems and poor transmission and acceleration make this a poor and hazardous vehicle to own.  It does get good mileage, when working. I have never experienced a new vehicle with so many issues in such a short period. Land Rover Corporate's attitude has been less than overwhelming. Extremely disappointed in the vehicle and the corporation.

Title: Stylish SUV
Review:  The Evoque is a fun car drive.  It looks great inside and out.  The ride is comfortable most of the time, although larger bumps are not suppressed.  It is a great handling SUV.  My gas mileage is about 21 in mixed driving, although the Evoque on board computer says its 23.  The transmission has 9 speeds, and it can take a second for it to find the gear you want in comfort mode, it reacts faster in sport mode.  The paddle shifters work well.  I would not recommend this as a family SUV it's too small, but if it's just you or just you and a friend or spouse, it's a great size.  The panoramic sun roof is a great feature at night or when it's not too hot out.  The stereo and navigation controls can use some improvement, they are slow to react to touch.  The climate system is excellent.  Overall, after one month and a thousand miles, I'm happy with the Evoque, it could use some updating in the electronics, and the gas mileage could be better, but I just enjoy driving it.

Title: Not that impressed ! 11 month update!
Review:  Okay, never wrote a review before so here it goes, I hope this helps others.I'm comparing our new 2015 Range Rover to our 2013  GLK 350. They both costs us about the same. We wanted to try the new Range Rover this time around. Let's start with the outside, we love the look however, no roof racks. You have to buy them at about $1400. The GLK looks like a family car while the Rovers lines look clean and stylish.The cargo door opens with the remote however, you have to push the button on the tailgate to make it close. The GLK you can just use the remote to open or close. The interior, the cargo bay is a lot smaller then the GLK. The driver seat feels okay not great. The finish work inside compared to the GLK , the GLK wins hands down. The steering wheel feels off, not sure why just yet. I can't put it into words, it just feels off. The sound system lacks just about everything, don't plan on rocking out while driving.The take off is good for a 4 banger, yet the transmission shifts hard in and out of gear at times. The interior noise level is a lot louder then the GLK. The GLK has a nice wood finish while the rover is plastic. The backup camera sucks! seriously guys you need to give this some real attention. The ride? This is where the rover is really lacking when comparing it to the GLK. If you hit a good size dip in the road plan on losing your back molars, felt more like a tank then a luxury rover. I'll update this after I take it off road. The rover feels light and you feel more of the road while the GLK is a much smoother ride. The navigation? This is a 50/50 the GLK navigation has no clue what I'm saying and there has been more then one time when I wanted to tear it out of the car over frustration. The rover map it tough to follow because it show you going north, south, east or west and you can get spun around looking at the map. The controls on the steering wheel are terrible on the rover. Don't push too hard on the volume or you will change the radio station, very frustrating, and no mute button. The back window is tough to see out of. The lane assist is on the weak side. The GLK makes a noise inside if you try to change lanes with a car in the blindspot, the rover just blinks,,the GLK one has saved my bacon more then once. The rover does have sensors that let you know you are too close in the front and rear while parking. The GLK does not, if it did my wife would not have backed into another car! The Bluetooth for your phone. Your really going to have to have some patients with the rover, you say a command, the command comes up on the screen and it ask you is this the correct command, it takes forever to get though the commands to make one call. The GLK just say a name and it makes the call. Feels like talking to a 5 year old with the rover, don't have too much coffee when asking the rover to make a call or you may end up losing it? this clearly needs some work.So why did we buy the rover? I lease a new car every 30 months and we really wanted to try the new rover. The new GLK won't be out until 2016 and I never want the first year of a completely new car. Just from the two weeks having the new rover and driving both side by side I'll most likely go back to another GLK after this lease is up. Glad this is my wife's car!Update after 11 months. Off road? It is very capable, my only complaint was all the cameras coming on, this is a great feature I'm just not sure how to use it yet. We were having a warning message coming saying all wheel drive not working, after four times in the dealership they got it fixed.The key fob stop working one day and I was stranded with no way to start the car. They sent a tow truck, at least their services department is on it and will take good care of you.As I mention previously the GPS in the rover sucks! I cannot tell you how many times it has taken me the long way or in the wrong direction completely. Rover services said there is nothing they can do to fix it. Rattles? This thing has on and off rattles that are driving me crazy. And I mean crazy! I take it in for them to find and fix and it won't do it for the dealership. It sucks gas likes it's free. Other then the cool factor of the body I'll be leasing another Mercedes-Benz once our lease is up.  Sorry rover, you guys need to work on your finished product a little better. For the same price I can get a better product. I feel if they make some corrections this could be a great SUV.Hope this helps others

Title: Really Love My RR!!!
Review:  I read another review the really throws this RR under the bus.  To be honest, there are a few quirks that need to be ironed out, but in general I LOVE my SUV.  It feels so solid and stable when you drive it, I do not worry about safety at all.  I live in a cold climate and heated seats are a must, but having a heated steering wheel and heated windshield - OMG! Love. Can't live without. It's true the app for the remote starts is pretty much junk, if they could work on that or offer an alternate remote start - it would go a long way.  Do my tires lose air, yep.  But that is very common in cold climates with this type of wheel.  Just pop into the dealer - they will fix it.  If the brakes get a little salt in them, they are quite squeaky and howly - again very common for colder climates albeit in super annoying.  In the last few sentences, I've told you all my complaints.  That's it. (Except that it does not have a garage door opener in  the mirror and also does not pop up text messages on the monitor - 3rd world problems.)  This SUV is the perfect height off the ground.  Not too low, not too high.  Friends with arthritis cannot say enough about the ease of access.  Winter driving?  Does anyone compare?  It was awesome. Easy. Safe. I would not have a problem lettting my kids drive the RR in a snow storm!   The 11 speaker Meridian sound system is amazing.  The back row seat are FULL SIZE!  Not a little kiddy bench.  Full size means a little bit less leg room, but just pull the front seat up.  My 2 boys, both over 6 feet tall, sit tandem all the time w/o complaints.  Plus the back seats are heated!  Cargo is limited, but still more space than a car. You feel like you are driving a car and not a school bus.  I really appreciate that because 90% of the time it is just me in the car.  I really can't say enough about my RR.  It was my first RR and I have been pleasant surprised.  I guess I thought it was a glorified name, but I was wrong!

Title: Shame on Land Rover
Review:  10 months owned, only 4500 miles, wife does not feel safe transporting grand children to nursery school, truly hates This vehicle.The ‘remote start’ feature is not on the key, ‘remote start’ Only works by iPhone app, has only a 25 percent reliability, and when it does start it does not turn on the climate control; so the vehicle is hot on warm days but more uncomfortably, it is very cold on cold days. A premium ‘cloth’ seat package would be helpful.The seat belts are difficult to reach between the seat and the door; also they are very difficult to get down to the latch/receptacle between the center console and the seat.There is a bright metal strip along the dashboard that reflects sun into the eyes of the front passenger.The tires need to be refilled every 60 days, the wheels are easily damaged due to a poor choice of tires, those wheels will collect snow/ice and will cause a very unsafe ‘bounce’ at 25 mph as they rotate out of balance.Shopping packages and contents will fall out of the vehicle as the lift gate opens.Front brakes are making a medium-pitched ‘howl’ sound, or is it from the back brakes?The value of this 2017 Land Rover Evoque has dropped $14,000 after only 4480 miles on the odometer.  Have been asking Land Rover for help pleasantly,  do not want to be put on a “forum” to evaluate future Land Rover vehicles, would like to receive a proper response from Land Rover … WTF !!    Where is the customer service?“Happy Wife Happy Life”  is not working here.Update:    Two visits back to salesperson, three service department visits ( loaner car given), at least 40 Emails and verbal communications with Land Rover Corporate  about the continued problems  ...  Then, the wonderful and persistent “customer care representative” from Land Rover corporate” made good.        A total of 15 months passed  … received a call from the Land Rover dealership General Manager, had a brief discussion to confirm the dissatisfaction and unresolved problems with the 2017 Evoque vehicle, two weeks later a refund check was issued less a prorated use cost (which was reasonable). The vehicle was turned back to that Dealer and the check was received.    The “experience”  has come to an end. .

Heated front and rear glass...heated steering and seats...you name it, this vehicle has it and all is top notch. Only been at dealer for regular maintenance. Of course thats pricey...but they check it over so well.

We have put 50K miles on this car over the last 3 years and it is THE MOST reliable car that I have ever owned. I always get 22-26 MPG mixed, 70% city and 30% highway, and the requires the absolute minimum maintenance such as brake pads, rotors and oil change. The timing belt had been just replaced when I bought the car and since then I only needed to replace the rotors, brake pads, spark plugs other than the regular oil change.

Title: Terrible gas mileage, no back seat room
Review:  Surprisingly little room for a luxury car. My wife's 2010 Insight had more room. We bought this hoping that the gas mileage would be better than rated, as I had heard some owners were getting 30mpg highway. We did not find that to be the case. Even without the 'PWR' button on, we were only getting ~22mpg highway on premium. Simply unacceptable for such a small car. Also the dash on these has a chronic melting issue on the passenger side airbag cover. Interior really does not hold up well over time. My car was an 04 but felt more like it was 15-20 years old. Got rid of it in less than 6 months and gladly took a loss on the sale. Maintenance at Lexus dealerships is expensive, take it to Toyota

I currently have 88,090 miles and I am still running on the original front brakes, clutch, belts & shocks! Driving stick really extends the life of your car. Only had to replace 1 bad shock, the battery, rear brakes and everything else is from 2004. About to change the timing belt, water pump, etc. but I'm almost at 90,000 miles so my is 300 has done me proud. You expect quality and reliability from Lexus/Toyota and they delivered.

Review:  Bought new in 04, hated it so traded my mom for her Audi, she's got 49K on it now and likes it. The car doesn't have the driver/road connection like my Audi or Saab and doesn't feel expensive like other Lexus cars. Around town speed is good but above 60 mph has no power. Original suspension had so-so handling & comfort. Suspension was replaced 3X by dealer bc it kept squeaking, now has K&N suspension & handles & rides better. Other then that no problems, not even brakes. Interior materials & design are cheap. MPG is pathetic. Auto trans is overeager to upshift into 2nd gear which dulls acceleration unless you stay heavy on the throttle- which eats more gas. Manual mode is worthless.

It was by far the most engaging, quietest, and tightest ride.  The G35 was faster in a straight line but I felt "one-with-the-car" driving the IS 300. Feels much faster than it really is. And it is not slow.  Beautiful styling in and out and great build quality.  Was also sold on the reliability record. Consumer Reports listed it as one of the top 3 most reliable cars for 2004.

After driving both cars, I realized the IS300 was the much better car across the boards.  Mechanically, the Lexus ran smooth and sound, with a lot more get-up and go.  The BMW was sluggish and seemed to hesitate a lot more, with some choppy shifting between gears.  I had been told by many people that the BMW would have more problems than the Lexus and in test-driving both, I had to concede that they were right.  I bought the Lexus.

Luxurious sedan as well as high performance sports car. The steering wheel shift buttons are awesome! 0-60 in 6.7 seconds which is on par with a Porsche Boxster! It handles like a dream!

I wanted a sports sedan with actual reliability and you cannot go wrong here. This is my first Lexus purchase and I believe I will stick with them after being very satisfied with my IS 300.

Title: U GOTTA GET THIS CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Review:  I drove a Civic DX for 8 years. The  last 2 of those years I was getting the  new car itch. I would get excited about  some other car models but would shortly  lose interest. BUT as soon as I seen  the IS300 - I KNEW it was the one! It  was like love at first sight. I bought  one in Feb04 and couldn't be happier.  Love the fact that not many people have  this car. People ask me all the  time "Is that a Lexus?"...or ask much  or say how much they love it. Lexus out  did itself w/ the IS300. It handles  like a dream. It's the perfect combo of  luxury and sport. Euro-car kids wanna  race when they see me...LOL. I've never  owned the same car twice, but when I do  go to get a new car it will be ANOTHER  IS300.

Review:  We had a couple of BMW 3 series before  this car and have been extremly pleased  with the quality and conveniences of  the Is300.  I would suggest to those  looking for an alternative to the BMW  and Acura to test drive this car!!  The  reliabilty, along with the unreal  pampering of Lexus has spoiled both my  wife and I.

Title: Reliability and fun
Review:  Its been 4 months and I'm loving every second I'm in it.  Luxury plus sporty features, its just great.  Has great handling, looks great, and built to last with that Toyota quality.  The only thing is gas mileage.  Your better off driving leisurely with it to get better gas mileage.  Driving it all city would hit you in the gas budget really fast.  Otherwise, I love my full package deal all leather.  Comfortable and has good speed not great, but something a modifaction of an exhaust and intake can help.

It surprises alot  of people it being a Lexus and Lexus  not being really associated with  sportscars.  The hit the nail on the  head with this one. Tons of aftermarket  parts for it if you wish to personalize  your ride.  No regrets here whatsoever.

Title: Fun car to drive 
Review:  The car is very fun to drive.  It takes  corners well with little to no sway.  E  shift is fun but cumbersome to use on a  regular basis.  The gauges take a  little time to get used to - The  speedometer is hard to read around the  5's.  The MPG guage is very distracting  since it bounces all over the place  telling you the instant MPG - not  helpful over the long haul.    Looked at the TL and G35 as well as the  ES300 they drove like a larger family  car which wasn't what I was looking for  at this time.  Inifinty dealership went  old school w/me with the hard sale.   Lexus dealership was the easiest car  purchase I have made to date.

Title: IS300 is amazing
Review:  This car is amazing in every respect  compared to its competition (G35, A4,  325,  c230, etc). Although it is not as  powerful as some in this list, it makes  up for it in superior handling, better  brakes, and a much more beautiful  design, inside and out. Since these are  not top sellers in this country, you  can easily find one fairly affordable  and at the same time have a car that  you dont see everyday (like the 325i).  I bought mine for 33k black/black auto  with navigation. This car could easily  go for 30k or lower. I suggest you  check this out if you are looking for a  car in the 30k price range. Also, this  is the most relibable lexus.

Review:  I really wanted to get a sports car  (I'm 53yrs old), but didn't want to  look like the old dude going through a  mid-life crisis.  This IS 300 with the  5-speed is the absolute answer.  Now  all the young kids say "kewl man" and  all the old folks say "hey, nice car"!!  Not only is it a delight to drive, it's  a sound investment, as the blue book  value remains relatively high for a  longer period of time.  Thanks Lexus!!!!

Title: ANNOYING TRANSMISSION HESITATION
Review:  The handling is extremely capable for  sporty driving and the brakes are  unrivaled.  The power is adequate and  smooth, though it tends to lug a little  at lower RPM's.  The E-shift allows  only limited control over shifting  (gears 2-5) and far too often down- shifts on its own.  A HESITATION  PROBLEM occurs in many IS300's as a  result of the vehicle's ICU (onboard  computer) malfuntioning -- a major  issue considering it is not detectable  during the intial test drive, gets  progressively worse, and according to  Lexus, is not correctable.

Title: 04 Sport Design Auto5 Sedan
Review:  Moving on from 6spd manual sports car. Ride comfort is as good as it'll get  while maintaining this wonderful  handling.  During sharp cornering,  moderate bodyroll.  Acceleration very  responsive, will not down shift  needlessly due to high torque and  close ratio gearing (even Auto).   Highway very stable, good throttle  response.  tourque is very high due to  inline-6, HP is just enough to give  spirited ride. The lack of performance  is balanced by luxury and handling.  You won't regret value VS price paid.  Purchased for invoice price, other  test drives include Subaru wrx Sti,  BMW330, Maxda RX-8, Infinity G-35,  Acura TL.

Review:  5spd auto "Sport Design", it is very  tourqy for what it's worth.   Excellant gearing, performance will  not be lost due to poor gearing as  seen in most autos.  Smooth shifts, and tourqiness.  0-60  in over 7 seconds, you won't soil  yourself but spirited enough.   Handling is as good as it's going to  get while maintaining a comfortable  ride.  Handles corners well, with  slight body roll.  Ride quality a shade behind the  bimmers.  Overall, im very pleased,  even in 04 this car still recieves  compliments.  Options available for  straight bolt on turbos, 300-500HP  from stock internals, when warrenty  expires.

Title: IS300 Blends youth and luxary into one.
Review:  I recently bought an IS300 5-speed  Transmission: Being a previous owner of a Honda  S2000, I was not overly impressed with  the shifting in this car.  The shifts  could be shorter and just a bit  smoother (less notchy).  Mind you, I am  comparing the 5-speed shifting with  that of the Honda S2000's.  Overall,  the 5-speed manual drives very similar,  if not better, than my friends 330ci.    Interior/Exterior: Very nice, except for the plastic  dash.  Lexus needs to upgrade to some  sort of rubber like the Audi's and  Beamers.  Exterior is Excellent!  The  smoked tail lights really help  differentiate between boy racers and  young professionals.

Review:  I like driving this car.  That being  said:  1)  tires.  The car comes  w/performance tires which means they  are soft -- i had to replace them at  20,000 miles. there is only one  replacement tire right now -- it cost  over $1,000 for 4 tires.  2)  reliability.  a few weeks ago the car  died in as i was accelerating in an  intersection.  it was towed to lexus  who tried to fix it for 2 days to no  avail.  on the 3rd day the car  miraculously started ... no explanation  whatsoever.  lexus customer service was  not helpful and pitiful.  i am  thoroughly disappointed with this car.

Title: It's a lexus? it's not a lexus family 
Review:  If you can afford IS300, I'm pretty  sure you have many other car to buy. I  already bought IS300 on 2001, I didn't  have that choice back then. IS300  looked the best at that time, but now  If you want to buy a new IS300, I  don't think you should consider  getting one. Why? The seat lumbar  support sucks for 6 ft tall people.  It's too low. It's too small. Handling  is okay. Engine is good, but for that  low hp with the bad gas milleage,  that's a big no no. Small power with  crazy gas milleage? You should  consider about that. You can buy Acura  TL, Infinity G35 coupe, Audi A4, Saab  9-3, etc. I regret buying IS300.

The quality of the  leather is very rough and hard, and the  seats are like sitting on a wooden  bench. It doesn't ride as smooth as the  IS,nor does it handle as well.

Review:  I bought my Navigator a few months ago and about a month after buying it we were in a 5 car collision  on the interstate my navigator came out of the wreck with a dented bumper that's it... IT SAVED MY FAMILY'S LIVES INCLUDING THE 8 MONTH TWINS IN THE 3RD ROW.... you could never get a better vehicle and gas mileage it pretty great considering its an SUV with a big V8.I love my navigator it's alot better than my 2000 expedition Eddie Bauer! This vehicle saved my family's lives on multiple occasions since I bought it, if you are in a position to get a Lincoln Navigator do so you will not regret it, it is a fantastic traveling and local vehicle, the best part is that you don't have to have premium fuel.... For someone who's had the LINCOLN  experience you will not regret buying...! (Update ... I have now had my 2008 Lincoln Navigator for almost 2 years now and is is the most fantastic vehicle I have ever owned I recently hit a deer a 40 mph and it only cracked the bumper and the grill which the insurance covered but I was completely shocked there wasn't ALOT more damage but that's it the brakes immediately responded it didn't slide or screach nothing it was amazing. I can go on and on at how great this car has been but to put it simply I would definitely buy another!!!)

Review:  I've had my Navigator for a few months now. I was leasing a 2008 GMC Yukon Denali before I decided to buy. I originally bought a 2007 Cadillac Escalade but took it back because it was too much like the Denali. The Escalade does handle better and has more power than the Nav but I do like the Navs interior a bit better. Love the 3rd row seat and the power fold feature. Denali and Escalade 3rd row was terrible. Also like that the Nav can switch from 2W to 4W drive. Denali and Escalade was AWD. Nav takes Regular Fuel while Denali and Escalade took Premium Fuel. Overall I am satisfied with the Nav though there is room to improve on it to better compete with other luxury brands.

The car is very large and takes a little bit to get used to if you haven't driven an SUV before. The sound system is great. Very reliable and well built. The only problem we had was an electrical one with the window which was fixed under warranty.

Review:  I bought this 6 months ago.  it took a few weeks to get the hang of driving it.  now I love it.  Plenty of power.  Really comfortable.  Tons of room for a 220 lb 6 footer like me.  just drove 3400 miles in two weeks on vacation with tons of gear and bicycles on the back.  made the trip very easy.  17.9 MPG on trip.  about 15 commuting to work and around town.  many really nice features

Title: Luxury Built Ford Tough
Review:  The exterior chrome and square gauges have a retro 1960s look.  The interior is all about comfort, luxury and modern technology.  Build quality is excellent compared to the competition. For someone who drives nothing but full sized V8 trucks, I was impressed with the gas mileage and power of the Navigator. The seats are very comfortable and there is all kinds of leg, side and head room in all 3 rows.

Title: Best One Yet
Review:  This is my third Navigator. All have been 2 year leases. I intend to buy this one at lease end. My first two had some electrical problems, especially with the easy exit system. This one been back once to replace the rear dvd, but other than that no problems. I love to drive this vehicle, especially on road trips. Gas mileage is low, but to be expected for a car this size. I really love the backup camera where it is in the reaeview mirror as it keeps sun glare to a minimum, whereas in dash cameras have that problem. Perfect family vehicle. The olny thing that keeps this car from being perfect is blue tooth.

Review:  Love it! This is the most comfortable car I have ever been in.  When my friends and I go out their Hondas and BMWs stay home and we take my Navigator becuase it's the most comfortable of all of our cars. I love that it never goes back to the dealership. My old Mercedes G500 spent more time at the dealer than with me so this is a wonderful improvement. My husband tells me that my Navigator is based on the same vehicle as his Expedition and he puts over 150,000 miles on them with no problems. I look forward to keeping my car for a long time.

Title: Solid in every way
Review:  This is our second Navigator and this is much better then the 2005 model we replaced. Recently towed a 7500 lb boat and had the vehicle packed for  vacation, trip was 120 miles each way and averaged 11 mpg. Handled the trailer like a champ. This model is significantly quiter then the model it replaces and seems smaller even though it is the same size. Engine and drive train are the same as the 2005 but the 2008 uses regular gas. Plenty of room for passengers and gear and the 3rd row seats are very comfortable even for large adults. The high itensity headlights are not as bright as the 2005 but the coverage is very good.

Comfort is excellent. Cup holders and compartments are well placed through out the vehicle and so on. Exterior design is not its strongest point, but overall has an excellent appeal with the 20' wheels and its unique grille design. I would definitely recomend this vehicle and would probably purchase another at some point .

Title: My 20 year love affair with Navi’s
Review:  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this vehicle. I’ve been driving Navigators  for almost 20 years. I owned one for five years, one for three years, and this last one for 12 years (bought it in October 2006).  I hate to let it go, but my kids are now grown, and I don’t need this much vehicle any longer.  All three of my Navigators have been reliable, and service at my dealership has been fantastic. I feel like a member of the family there. The ONLY Downside is fuel economy. Terrible in the city (9-10) Slightly better on the highway (17).   2006 was the last year that the Navigator was made without an auxiliary or USB port.   That technology came out starting in 2007.

Review:  This beast has been a pleasure.  It has hauled our family of seven on several trips to Florida, hauled boats and jet skis, and innumerable trips to Home Depot, while making the trips to the grocery store and school functions with ease.  The 4WD/AWD makes it feel very safe in bad weather, and although we haven't needed much in the way of service it was easy to get worked on, no matter where we were (not so much with our BMW!) The power rear seat and video options made this a kid cruiser without equal.  This isn't a practical vehicle for everyone, but it was a wonderful choice for us.  40k miles, no regrets.

Title: Lincoln Experience
Review:  I traded in my 2000 Navigator for a new 06.  This is my 25th year to drive Lincolns and this is my last Lincoln. The truck is nice to drive and visually appealing but the fit and finish are terrible.  (2) trips to the dealer for interior repair, (3) trips for the Sirius radio repair and finally took vehicle to Visteon retailer for repair (bad unit) (1) trip to fix.  The final deal breaker was the left power fold mirror not retracting.  The truck was 34 months old and had 36,400 miles and Ford would not provide warranty repair.  I was told by the Service Manager that if the mirror glass were broken, and I had glass coverage, they could bill my insurance company.    Unbelievable!

Title: Best Vehicle I've Owned
Review:  Very comfortable to travel in, and definately noticed when on the road.  Like it or not, people sometimes DO judge you by what you drive.  Sound system, remote folding mirrors, retractable running boards, air- conditioned front seats and electric tailgate all get comments.  The third row seating is adult sized, and the electric folding seat option is worth having.  With judicious driving I get 18 mpg without much effort, but average 15 mpg.  There is a big difference between city driving and cruising with this car.  I've maxed 21.7 mpg on one perfect trip to LA.

Title: 2006 Navigator, my 4th
Review:  After having a 1998, 2001, 2003, and now a 2006 Navigator, I must say the 2003 overall ride/performance  was the best. The 2006 engine noise is more on hard acceleration, the 6 speed transmission still has shift issues, especially in slow traffic, lots of clunking and ruff shifts. My 06 now has only 18,000 miles. Need for premium gas is a negative when gas was running 4 plus bucks a gallon. Could have better ride on rough roads, original Michelin tires ride not as good as Continentals. Replaced with Pirelli 20 in, as supplied on 2007's, nice riding tires, & looks great with 07 rims, but a noisy bumpy ride for first 10 minutes till they round out, but great in snow.

Title: Overpriced Bucket of Bolts
Review:  So I've had my Navigator for about 2 yrs now and have had it in the shop at least 5 times. The most common issue was the plastic side plate where the seat controls are located. The drivers side has had to be replaced three times and the passenger once. Another annoying issue was the passenger side door.  he panel keeps popping off.  3 times for this. After the 1st time it was fixed the seals began leaking.  I've now had to have the seals replaced twice.  Most currently were the fan control, navigation, and transmission issues. One doesn't expect to have tranmission issues after only two yrs and paying $60K. Other minor issues include the 3rd row vent popping, and 2nd row trim pcs missing.

Title: A leftover 2006 Navigator w/3 dings...
Review:  The 2006 Navigator is a wide body luxury experience; however, the interior does not live up to its level of classification, as many have already mentioned.  My vehicle is a leftover and has hail damage (3 dings) that the dealership has agreed only to repair one at its cost.  The 2007 has a cleaner and leaner interior, but the button to fold the side mirrors inward is very confusing.  The drive, however, is smoother then the 2006, and you feel in control as you quickly pass on lookers, who can only look in envy.

Review:  After 8 months no issues with drivetrain except for poor gas milage 13.1 mpg. Interior fit and finish is horrible. Excessive wind noise from drivers window. Many rattles coming from cheap plastic components such as glove box, a/c vents, 2nd row storage console, and dvd player. Quality in leather is marginal at best. Carpets are starting to show signs of wear after 10k miles. Dealer is not geared to fix these type of quality issues at their location, very frustrating. Will not purchase any Lincoln or Cadillac product again. Very nice on the surface with 0 miles, 8 months into is a different story. Looking at MB GL450, Audi Q7, will unload this Navigator at a huge loss. I hope this will help.

Title: Great for a Lincoln
Review:  The Navigator is a hit with us, but now Mercedes and GM are making more economic and Luxurious SUVs, so Lincoln needs to stay int the game. The car is really noisy and (OBVIOUSLY) it's a real pain in the neck to fill it up at the pump. It's very comfortable and the third row is actually quite spacious. Overall, if you're someone who wants a luxury full size SUV, I might recommend the Audi Q7 or M-Benz GL450 a tad bit more, but if you need to haul a lot(I mean A LOT!), I'd recoomend this car a tad bit more than the GL, Q7, or Escalade (just a tad, because the design of both the exterior and interior isn't as elegant as the Mercedes or Audi).

Review:  This is my second Lotus. My first was an 05 Elise with 190bhp, a soft top, and standard ("Touring") suspension. My new S240 could not be a more different car. This Exige is serious business. The acceleration is spectacular; when you get on the throttle the supercharger sounds like a jet engine and you quickly become one with the driver's seat. I really enjoyed the handling and cornering of the Elise, but the Exige S240 with the Track Pack is not to be believed. The capability of this car to corner hard with minimal body roll is unlike anything you have experienced before (including 360 Modena's and Gallardo's that I have driven).

Review:  Well, this is the second Exige I've bought and for those that thought  the S version was hot in 07, this limited 240S for US release in 08 is just outstanding. I'll put this simply, this is the street version track car. Not much has changed overall, unless you count the interior is redone, has the launch capability, better, bigger brakes, 4 piston calipers and (gasp) a cupholder! Now, I didn't think that Lotus could improve the Exige, even with the superchager in 07. I waited since my first one was the first release without the SC. I was going to buy the track version, but heard that I should wait. I'm glad I did... so worth it! This Exige is is the BEST! Words can't describe the feeling

The interior is the best looking  interior of any car I have ever been  in.  Leather is everywhere and it is of  the highest quality.  While ferrari  does own maserati they are very  different cars. This car is a GT car,  smoother ride and without the wild  looks of a ferrari but it still gets  tons of attention. It is in the same  price range as the SL500 but much rarer  and faster.  Do not get the nav system  it is almost useless,  barely showing  any information.  The paddle shifters  are amazing, though the 6 speed manual  is very smooth too.

The winter months have taken a toll on rear wheel wells but over all truck is in great shape. I have replace normal parts over the years. At about 167k I had to replace timing chain that broke going down the road. Everyone and there brother told me I shouldn’t attempt to fix. I found a friend to do the job after many mechanics refused too. And once it was put back together it ran as it did the day I bought it. Its currently still on the original clutch. Many years ago I bought life time warranty parts on shocks, starter,  alternator used shocks 4 times, starter once, alternator once. Have to say I’ve gotten my money out of this truck 10 fold.

Review:  Though an excellent value used (high depreciation), there are better choices available.  Truck was bought used with 60k mi, has 129k today.  It is a good looking truck, with good utility for a compact.  However, despite some improvements for the '98 model, the chassis/underpinnings date back to the '83 Ford Ranger.  This is a very crude truck.  It rides smooth only on fresh asphault.  Otherwise, the truck shudders, flexes, jiggles and jolts on even the smallest bumps.  The clutch grabs very late, but since the 3.0 150 hp V6 is weak, I wouldn't want the automatic.  Handling is okay, but the steering and brakes are numb/totally lifeless. High dash makes this truck unfriendly for shorter folks.

We have driven it for over 125,000 miles with very few problems - a broken heater and cruise control are the only things that we have had go wrong.  We once took it Christmas tree hunting - all the other vehicles got stuck in the snow, but not my little Mazda!  I love this truck and hate to part with it, but I need more room. :(

Title: Electrical Storm
Review:  First pickup I've owned which I refer to as my toy truck.  Fuel pump had to be replaced then techs twisted neck behind cap; unable to pump any gas in.  It was 2 years before techs were able to diagnose electrical problem. Installed 2 new different batteries as truck would be dead if it sat for 2 days. Replacement of running light relay switch, ABS module plus the door switch. Still have electrical ghosts that haunt the truck. Sluggish for a 6 cylinder drives more like a 4 cylinder.

Title: Solid truck
Review:  Great small truck.  AC replaced under warranty the only problem in 113,000 miles.  Brakes last 50K, factory shocks replaced at 60K.  Cups tires on front but current Michelin's have 60K and should last another 15K.  Brakes are weak, probably a result of the 31x10 tires.  Still gets 16mpg in city and 20 on highway, same as when new.  I have been very satisfied with this vehicle.

Title: Madza built by Ford
Review:  I have previously owned Toyotas and  Mazdas made in Japan and their quality  is far superior to this Mazda B3000  made by Ford. I have had consistent  problems with the dome light staying  on, the fuel pump failed at 32,000 mi  and the front and rear breaks had to be  rebuilt before 40,000 mi. The gas  mileage leaves much to be desired. This  cannot compare to my Toyota 4Runner  that lasted for 12 years and better  than 250,000 miles with very little  maintenance.

Title: Not Bad
Review:  I bought this truck new in 98.Its the  extended can V-6. I found out very  early that i had to put premium grade  fuel in this truck, or it would knock  and ping terribly. Thats a bit of a  bummer, because i bought a smaller  truck to save $ on gas. I need to have  the fuel intake changed out $700.00,  and not covered in warranty.  Overall i cant be too disappointed in  this truck. The accelaration needs to  be improved. A 4 cyl. Toyota or Nissan  blows my doors off.

Review:  This truck after 90000 miles would rate about an average from me.After about 50000 miles I had to get my steering rack replaced,Which was covered by my extended warranty.The dome light  switches in the doors would not turn off,which I went back twice for repair.  And off and on I did have slight problems with my clutch. Until now which the entire assembly needs  replacement(not covered by my  warranty).So I can tell you that this  truck is not the same quality of the same MFG. that I had bought in 1992.

Title: Tough little truck
Review:  Very satisfied with this tuff little truck. Bought a slightly used, stripped down 4X4 B4000 44,000 miles ago.  (A/T but no power locks/windows or cruise control).  Love being up high with the big offroad tires, and not worrying about such things as curbs and snowdrifts.  The 4-wheel drive works great.  The ride is firm but the big tires absorb most road defects.  The engine is quiet, unless really pushed, and the transmission shifts are even seamless at times.  Acceleration is a bit sluggish, but I could probably pull a house on wheels with all this torque.  The Mazda's are also more attractive then the Fords from the front end styling to the slightly flared rear side panels.

Title: Fantastic vehicle
Review:  We bought our Mazda truck almost 4 years ago and the only reason the previous owner was selling it was because he had terminal cancer and could no longer drive.We have gotten so much value and dependability from our truck and it still runs strong.We could not ever sell our truck and it has been so dependable for us.Never once has it ever broken down on us and parts seem to last forever.The only part we have had to replace is things that require general upkeep .The battery is our only replacement .We service it every 3 months for oil changing and to make sure all the belts and hoses are good.Never have had to replace any yet.I strongly suggest considering a Mazda for your next vehicle.We have a 2008 Mazda 6 and she runs strong too.They build vehicles to last and last.

Title: Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned
Review:  I have a website dedicated to my year 2000 Mazda B2500 SX, and the reason is because this truck is simply unbeatable in terms of reliability, affordability, and durability. I've put some money into getting things fixed, but I've largely been able to do all the fixes myself, from a clutch to U-joint, to an alternator, to a starter. At this point, if I had to put $1500 into it to get the transmission rebuilt, for instance (which I won't have to because it's 5-speed tranny is bulletproof), I'd spend the money. Sure I could buy a new vehicle at that point, but why? I have one of the best little trucks the world has ever seen!

Title: the little truck that could
Review:  My dad bought this truck used 9 yrs ago as light general duty truck. It was the most reliable vehicle we ever owned. It became my first car in 09 when i was 16. In 9 years the only problems were a bad ignition and leaking roof, that's it! The thing was tougher than any truck Ive ever seen, a bumpy gravel road at 60 mph was a walk in the park. I cant believe a truck could get 24 mpg and it may not have much power but that's why its light duty. The 5 spd manual had perfect gear ratios. My truck was mazda ZOOM ZOOM fast but not really haha, topped out at 80. it was eventually rear ended by a truck going 70 mph but i was okay, it got annihilated but saved my life.

Review:  Purchased this new in 1999 and it has been a perfect utility vehicle.  No problems at all and has been in shop only for routine maintenance which is minimal.  Still all the original systems including brakes.  Just replaced the original tires.  Rides smooth for a small truck and handles well in all conditions for a two wheel drive.  Good gas mileage and simple systems and controls.  It's a 4 cylinder (which I recommend for reliability) and a manual transmission.  Paint and trim are still like new.

Title: Props
Review:  I have owned this truck for 5 years now and have had zero problems.  It plows through snow, has good acceleration, and the interior is still in awesome shape.  I had it rust proofed and the paint sealed so it looks like it did 5 years ago.  When I am ready to sell this truck, someone is going to get very lucky.  My only gripe would be that the 3.0 V6 engine is a bit of a guzzler.  I get around 17-21 mpg.  For being a 4x4 that is fairly high off the ground, it handles very well and has a tight turning radius.  This has been a great truck.

Review:  Mine has 450000 miles and doesn't even knock. I've totaled it and wrecked it after that. It was wrecked even worse about 8 times before I got it. Not to mention I was t boned in by a vehicle going 50mph while I was turning at a 4 way. Ruined my fender, door, snapped my spindle/hub. Dinged the cab and didn't touch the frame. Airbags did deploy so it's not worth anything to some one with half a mind but I lucked and had a friend with the same truck with a blown motor. Not to mention same color. Everyone said scrap it. I figured since its been such a bad ass little truck that has never broke down on me through the 200000plus miles it's taken me. I'll just swap everything to mine. Now it's back to the same beauty she used to be

Title: 131k Miles - Still Running Strong
Review:  I've been under this vehicle a lot, and let me tell you, for it being a midsize truck it is built like a brick BLEEP-house.  It's a V6, pulling a heavy mid size truck, this isn't one of those small pickups, it is a mid size truck that gets close to the same MPG as small pickups, esp. since I have the 4WD.  For a truck that is 16 years old, it is running like a beast. I was out shooting and a full size truck (Chevy Silverado) was stuck at the bottom of a hill in some soft dirt. My little truck in 4WD was able to pull the truck out of the soft dirt, and up the dirt hill, and his truck had no power the entire time.  Vehicle has great MPG, great performance (for what it is) & it's reliable

I had to replace 4x4 hub on the front but as I regularly am off road this is just a minor repair. This truck is a little under powered for heavy loads that approach its weight limit but it pulls my 19 foot bass boat and camping trailer just fine.

When I go to sell it, someone will be getting a great deal. Besides normal maintenance, oil changes and brakes I cannot complain. Rear wheel drive can present some problems during inclement conditions. For the money the Mazda truck is a great value and I would buy another in a heartbeat, although I wish they would update their body style (not much has changed within the past 10 years).

Title: Could be better
Review:  I bought this truck used in 2005 and it had 79K on it.  It ran fine for about 2 months, when suddenly a brake line busted when I was in a parking lot.  Had to get a complete brake job done because everything was so rusted.  Soon after, I had a problem with the Check Engine light coming on, because it blew an oxygen sensor.  Fuel gauge hasn't worked right since I bought it.  Runs poorly on the highway, only getting about 20 mpg with 3.0 L V6.  Manual 4 spd w/overdrive is a bad choice, bc if there is a slight hill on highway and you are in OD, you will not be able to maintain speed uphill.  Runs at WAY too high of RPM on highway.  Engine is too loud.  Not very reliable.  Body starting to rust.

It's not a V-6; if I had wanted one of those I would have bought it.  It's not a Tacoma; ditto.  It gives me 25 mpg  with the air on and a passenger and camping supplies at 70 mph.

Review:  I bought this truck with 23,000 miles. It's a nice truck, but avgs about 12mpg. It's gone as low as 9 and as high as 19. The dealer wouldn't fix it. I had to go to another dealer. They replaced the computer, ign. coil and rear driveshaft and the yoke on differential. This truck had 30,000 miles. That improved the mpg by 3mpg. This is a V-6 not a V-8. It also has a problem they can't find with the gas gauge varying. Sometimes it's 1/3 tank, then empty and the low fuel light is on, then back to 1/3 tank. Once it's below 1/3 tank you don't know how much gas is left. It is great for towing. It handles very well in adverse conditions or when doing emergency manuevers.

Title: Not Bad. . . 
Review:  The 4.0L V6 provides plenty of  starting, passing, and pulling power.  City gas mileage with the A/C on is  miserable, ~15mpg. Without cargo, this  truck is sometimes embarassing to drive  on hilly roads (like Seattle) in the  rain, as the rearend is very light. I  end up using the 4WD to make turns on  hills and quick moves into traffic from  side streets. Reliability has been  good, at 59,000 miles I've only had one  problem, minor at first, that turned  worse because of lack of interest from  the original dealer. A different dealer  immediately addressed the problem (then  big) and did a warranty repair. All  things considered, this is a good  vehicle.

Title: Some quirks, but overall a good truck
Review:  It quite capable as an off-road truck  (with good tires) and it's also pretty  smooth on the road.  The engine is a  bit of a dog, and you really have to  work it to get any acceleration (best  b/w 3-4000 rpm).  I found mine to be  rather loud from the engine  compartment, and the driveshaft and  transmission make alot of subtle clunks  and clanks.  I was able to get 20-23mpg  in the summer, but only 16-19 in the  winter (hwy)

Title: Pings
Review:  So far at 45000 miles it's been a good  truck. I use it for a work truck,  hauling tools and occasionally I pull a  trailer. The only problem I have is at  certain speeds and acceloration I get  pinging. I took it in and had a new  computer installed, but still have the  same problem. Also, when it pings it  smokes. Not has much with higher octane  but it still does it.

Yes but at what price? 10 mpg. pulling the boat,and maybe 50 mph on any kind of hill (2200 lbs). The owners manual says 3500 towing. It is no where near that in real life. Also the gas mileage is not great @ 18 mpg.empty and that is with a bed cover.

Problem with sensors going out.  I keep  having problems with the  engine "pinging" no matter what kind of  gas is put into it.

Title: My 2000 Mazda B2500 SE Regular Cab
Review:  Overall, the truck has been a delight  to own.  Really researched my purchase  and for the money, I think this is one  of the best values on the road.  To  date, I've put roughly 60,000 miles on  the vehicle and have had no engine  related problems to speak of.  The  only "major" problem I have had was the  heater went out at about 35,000 miles,  which was promptly fixed by the  dealership.  As another reviewer  mentioned, the CD player does tend to  get excessively hot after extended use,  so the CD's come out of the player  nearly scalding hot, however the CD  player and speaker system sound  terrific.  The gas mileage should be  better, as I get 22 mpg with an  automatic.

Title: Great Truck for the Money
Review:   I had been searching for some time for a pickup that was both economical to operate and comfortable to drive. The Mazda B2500 fits both criteria with added bonuses thrown in.  I am 6'3" tall and I usually have a difficult time getting in and out of the smaller sized pickups. I have tried , Isuzu, Dodge Dakota,Etc....all with the same result...I feel like I need to unfold after climbing in or out. I can actually sit upright in a Mazda B2500! I have also been averaging 28-30 mpg!

Title: good little truck
Review:  I had a ranger before the mazda and they are about the same inside, look alikes by ford. Bought this little truck when gas was $4 a gallon and the astetics of the truck i like but i only get around 15mpg with it is a auto but my ranger 2.3 was around 20. I have to run supreme in mine or i get the "pinging" when i am on the highway. Was alittle disappointed in the lack of power in the 3.0. But i love the truck but i think i am going back to a diesel. Same mpg but bigger and the differance between supreme and diesel is about .10. Little sluggish on the hi-way. Overall i say that it is a good little truck for what it was made for. My dad road in the excab for 500 miles. he is tuffer than i am.

Title: CLK55
Review:  Initial electrical problems with the interior operating components. The local dealer was more then helpful, always providing a loaner even though I did not buy it from them. After several visits, the dealer seems to have exorcised the electrical gremlins and the car is an absolute joy to drive. I can average 23 MPG if I drive at regular speeds. However, it is difficult to do that as this car constantly asks for more spirited driving and rewards you with a well balanced and stunning performance and , even with my driving style, still returns an average of 18MPG! I LOVE THIS CAR! I have a 2003 Corvette Z06 and did not drive it all summer because I would always turn to the Mercedes for driving.

The first year I drove it was great. Doesn't matter if you're young or old, people will turn their heads to see who is driving this car. I picked this car for the sleek yet muscular body style that the newer models do not have. My best friend went online after I got this car and purchased a certified MB CLK 430 as well, but he failed to realize that the heated seats and halogen headlights weren't standard. The power of the 430 is amazing and often found myself flooring the gas pedal to feel the G force push lay me back.

Review:  I purchased my CLK320 after looking at the 300 series BMWs, the "baby Lincoln", and a '99 CLK.  I have never regretted my decision to go ahead and buy (at a non-discounted price!).  I drive R/T either DC-Bowling Green (KY), Bowling Green-Louisville, Bowling Green-Chicago, or Bowling Green-Jacksonville (FL) at least once a month and enjoy every mile.  If I could change one thing with my CLK, it would be to incorporate a CD/tape player with the CD holder in the trunk.  I have found 2 minor annoyances: one with the light electrical system...I've had four blown bulbs in 4 years.  The other is the rear window screen. Over time it does not retract properly.

Review:  Let me go on record by saying that I  have owned a 95 BMW M3 and 01 330ci &  these editors dont know what they're  talking about. After having owned 2  BMWs, I saw BMW was closer to an Acura  than a Mercedes. When I left BMW  behind and bought a CLK 430 I saw has  the power, features, looks, handling,  and quality that as a WHOLE make it  cut above ANY coupe from BMW. These  editors do not understand this as  they have never personally owned these  cars. When I test drove and priced out  that Honda Civic Look alike- the  330ci, I was shocked to see that they  were charging $42K for a $34K car.  Audi makes a better product called the  S4 at these prices.

Review:  I don't think it is  particularly "flashy" from the outside  but it just takes a quick drive to find  out just how much fun this car is.   Although it takes premium gas, my  overall after 6500 miles per the car's  computer is 24.5 miles per gallon. On a  recent trip I averaged 30 mpg!  A added  bonus I didn't expect.  The only down  side of this car is the seats are un-  comfortable and the adjustments are few  unless you have some special added  package that I don't have.  Get rid of  the heated seats and put in adjustments  to make it more comfortable. That is my  opinion.

Title: The W208 CLK will prove to be a classic
Review:  My '02 CLK just had its 1yr  anniversary, and I must say I LOVE THE  CAR. This is my first MB and probably  won't be my last. Lots of power &  comfort, very aggressive yet forgiving.  Gas mileage is about the same as my V6  Accord. Safety & luxury features are in  abundance. Everything is very  ergonomically designed, and the  infrared keys are the best. The pop-up  trunk makes loading easy, and remote  open/close windows and sunroof are  nice. Engine noise is practically  unheard of from the inside cabin  (opposite of BMW). Acceleration &  braking is very smooth (opposite of  BMW).

Title: A pleasure to drive
Review:  This is my second CLK, I purchased a  CLK 320 in March '00 and was very happy  with the veh. I traded the 320 for CLK  430 in June'02 The 430 is so much more  responsive and powerful. I've own other  sports cars in the past and I would  place the 430 at the head of the class.  It affords me a level of expected  quality and pestige that only MB can  coupled with the fun of driving a true  sports car.

Review:  Everything is great about this car,  except there is no CD changer in it as  a standard option.  I think it is very  cheap of Mercedes to do such a thing  when Toyota Corolla's already come with  CD players.  Even worse, it can only be  a Mercedes Benz CD Changer since there  are Fiber optic wires included.  Retail  will run anywhere from $700-$1200.

Review:  For my whole life, I've been a staunch  supporter of American automobiles.   However, due to "unfixable" problems  with each of the three cars I've owned,  it was time to try a foreign automobile.  When I test drove the Mercedes Benz CLK  430, I was sold immediately.  It is  undoubtedly the finest car that I have  ever owned.  Everything about the car  is spectacular, from the interior  styling and exterior design of the car,  to the great performance and tight  ride.  I'll definitely be sticking with  Mercedes Benz for all future car  purchases.  It's a head turner!

Title: Wonderful Car
Review:  This is a great car!  Fun to drive,  lots of power and very smooth and  quiet.  Seems to be most happy at  about 80 mph on the highway.  Gets  29mpg at that speed.  I am 6'4" tall  and have no problem getting  comfortable.  Quality is very high  although I have had some problems with  interior rattles.  The dealer took  care of them at the first service.  My  only complaint is the door sills seem  to get dirty very easily with scuff  marks from my and my passenger's  shoes.  I think it is related to the  type of plastic that is used.   Otherwise, I have no complaints and  enthusiastically recommend this car.

Title: Great til something breaks!
Review:  When I first got Heidi (yes, I named my clk430 Heidi), I was in love. The way this car takes turns, accelerates, and performs overall is amazing.  Then, at a mere 77,000 miles- stuff started to break...the convertible top computer went out all the time, and eventually died (1400$ part), the cats needed to be replaced (1000$)...then after all that, the trans started slipping...after getting multiple quotes to fix all the problems and replace the trans, I was looking at about 5000$ worth of repairs.  I made the choice to trade her in for the Lamborghini inspired Toyota mr2 spyder.  The opinion of many mechanics was that the clks trans tends to die at 80k miles. Way too soon in my opinion.

The handling is great and the top is easy to work (the next year Mercedes make the top fully automatic). I would recommend the CLK to any person that enjoys the being out and about. The trips to Las Vegas make this ride a must! Just wish that bluetooth was readily available in 2002.

Title: Rag top in the snow belt
Review:  A great year-round car. With snows on in winter drivability is excellent - we get 100" of snow a year. The top is very well insulated & quiet. On any sunny day above 55 degrees I have the top down. The wind screen does a great job of keeping the cabin serene and the heated seats keep you warm, that way you can focus on the excellent exhaust note. Mileage is good at 24MPG and 27MPG highway. This is a cruiser-not a sports car. Performance is adequate, not stellar. High speed cruising is addictive and one can blast to high speed and beyond without realizing it, even with the top down - It's that well designed.  I targeted this car specifically over the new model as this one is designed by Bruno Sacco.

Title: Mid-life refresher
Review:  The CLK320 Cabriolet is truly a fun car to drive and a head turner even in a crowd of Benz's, BMW's, Caddies, et al.  There are a few weaknesses though in the clunky suspension and lack of steering feedback. As I tell my son, it's a luxury car not a sports car speedster.  For class, style, and practicality I don't think there's anything on the market even close, although reviews that say it seats 4 adults "comfortably" must be based on the opinion of some small folks.  You can get 4 in, but nobody is very comfortable.  Engine is strong, even if not real quick off the line and the highway ride is dangerously smooth - 100mph creeps up on you easily.  If you're looking at this car - BUY IT - you won't be sorry!

Title: Excellent Drive ....Terrible Reliability
Review:  On performance I give it very high  marks.  However, mercedes cuts corners  on quality. This is my second CLK.  My  first was plaqued with problems ranging  from engine trouble (random stalling)to  window failure. In fact, I couldn't  sell it because mercedes couldn't not  get the "check engine" light to go  out.  I was forced to trade it in.  My  second CLK has had one problem after  another ranging from not starting, to  seat controls, to air conditioning..the  list goes on. The wood grain bleeds  into the leather on the doors.  Don't  order the hands free phone.  50% of the  time the car doesn't recognize the  phone is plugged in and you are forced  to pull over to reset the engine. Bad  sound quality also

This car drives great.  I took it down the Coast Highway last  summer and had a blast. The car is a  real eye catcher too. I get compliments  on it every time I take it out. It's  also very quiet with the top up, even  though that's not often for me. The  seats are very comfortable too, its  been to LA and back a few times.

Our other car is a Lexus ES350 which is a safe bet boring sedan and I convinced my wifey to get this 'for her.' Let's just that it is not a 335 twin turbo but has enough power under the hood and looks better than comparable cars, way better. It drives well enough and I have been inventing excuses just to take it on the road. So far, I don't have any annoying rattles or anything. Best looking I owned.

In my neck of the woods, Lexus rules; Beemers are well-represented, too. I was loyal to Lexus, but in my heart of hearts, I wanted an MBz. A good friend and private dealer found my new baby. At first sight, it was so beautiful, I was afraid to drive it. It was too fancy, too ostentatious, too TOO. Took about a week to get over it. I am in love. Smitten. Besotted to the point of purchasing a custom cover to minimize sun damage (blk ext, no tinted windows, hot sun, all that leather). Co-workers tease, but that's OK!

Here's the list: Blown speaker, Wheel Balance off, Drivers side seat holder broken, Engine Pulley replacement, Middle brake light out, and chip in windshield.  I know you might be thinking...most of these things were rigged so I didn't find them instantly and I got to those so far and only owned it a few months. Terrible customer service and a terrible car.

But as they say about Monet's paintings; it was good from afar and far from good. The litany of problems with this car ranges from a new transmission at 20,000 miles to multiple broken window motors. And I don't even want to get started on the apocalyptic depreciation. In exactly 2 years of ownership, it is worth less than half of what I bought it for. It is such a terrible feeling to get into a car everyday and wonder what will go wrong with it next. So please take note and do not buy this car.

Oh yes, it's a sweet ride, and I jump out of bed every morning and look forward to the pleasure of driving this little jewel to work. I chose black with an ivory interior. My last CLK was a 320 and it was in a gorgeous pewter color, but I did have some electrical probs with it. So far this '06 CLK350 has been a dream. It is a work of art, and when you get behind the wheel you feel like you've arrived with all the leather, polished burlwood, and the slightly retro design of the dash and fittings.

Review:  I purchased one of these used, from the original owner, the car currently has 125,154 miles on it and still is in excellent shape both cosmetically, and mechanically. This car is very simple to maintain, and everything is simple to use, no fancy things like on modern cars, but isnt completely in the dark ages. Instrumentaion is plenty, and easy to read, stock radio is very good, and cassette deck is still working fine. The leather interior has also held up very well for being 15 years old and has no holes or tears, trunk space is absolutely massive! A perfect summer home rental for tourists! The 4.6L V8 is an excellent motor, and can get out of its own way when asked to, and I personally get about 18.5MPG in town and 26MPG out on the highway on 87 octane. Its been an excellent car, and I can see why they last so long, one of Ford's highest reliability cars/platform! I would recommend one of these to anyone who's looking for a smooth car, with excellent reliability, cheap to service, but still doesnt kill the pocketbook on gas.

Title: Wish my Dad could have enjoyed this car
Review:  I can't say enough good things about this beautiful car.  I bought mine in February 2009 with only 56,000 miles on it and lots of garage time, so it is immaculate.  What a pleasure to drive.  Mine is the LS with the billboard size digital dashboard readings and all the bells and whistles.  Though it is seven years old, everything works perfectly.  Never and oil leak or a squeek or a squak.  The ride will nearly put ya' to sleep.  My worst MPG is 21.6 mpg and my best is 25.8.  Nuttin' wrong with that.  Love this car, and just wish Daddy could have seen it, as he loved Mercs!  This is my first one after owning Dodges, Buicks, Olds, and Pontiacs.

Title: A Real Car
Review:  The rear wheel drive remains appealing to this buyer given the mechanical simplicity of the power train. Proper winter snow tires are essential for driving on snow and ice and where permitted studded tires improve traction immeasurably. I have owned Lincolns through the years and the Marquis is of equal space and ride quality at a significantly lesser price.

Review:  This car handles like a dream. I don't know where some of the people get off giving it a bad review. I am 43 years old and have driven everything from Beetles to Vettes. This is a great car for the money, runs strong and mileage is fine. Especially for a big car. This car looks and runs great.

Title: Good Car that Could Be Better
Review:  My experience with FoMoCo products is that they are good ideas poorly executed. My Mercury is a case in point.  While perfect for people looking for a traditional RWD sedan that owns the road, this car lacks the solidarity and reliability its predecessors possessed.  It handles well for its size in braking, acceleration, and cornering.  It also is a good ride on the highway.  But don't expect too much from it. The engine has mounds of torque but is noisy when pressed. The engine is a great performer, but you got to go light on the gas unless you (a) can afford speeding tickets and (b) are related to a Saudi prince and have inherited your own private oil well.

Title: Seat Belt Problem
Review:  I like the car in every way. It gets 19 mpg city/hwy. One can only sit on 3/4 of the front seats as the seat belt receptor is solid and sticks up through the seat. It can not be moved. Without that seat belt reception problem, one could sit in the middle of the seat and get support on the right side of the cushion. As it is one sits on the left side support and middle of seat: extremely uncomfortable. It would be ok for a small person, i.e., 100 pounds or less could sit in middle.

Title: room for six
Review:  dumped 95 sse pontiac for a car that could hold 2 extra people for trips to town etc.,(bucket seats are for college kids- not FAMILY cars) and could never bring myself to buy a top- selling Asian car with no trunk or interior capacity, and front wheel drive durability inconsistencies, and wound up with the only option available that wasn't MEGA- Bucks,foreign, or a glorified station wagon (aka SUV). True more people would look at us if we had 23's, or full-fledge aero kits, flip down DVD's,etc. Oh well, the price you must pay if your wife tilts the scales at 300+, your kids pack enough junk for a weekend trip for a whole summer camp, and you have a lead foot that eats CV joints for breakfast

Title: Cushy gas  hog has issues
Review:  We were so excited to get into this buttery ride only to have our Marquis buzz killed when the fuel pump went out at 47,000 miles after only having it a month & one 400 mile trip under our belts. Another surprise was the terrible city mileage, much lower than the stated 17 mpg, around 10 mpg. Highway ok w/25 mpg. As I've seen mentioned I have to agree the lack of a center console leaves one stuffing everything into the paltry pockets given in the front seats or on the floor. So despite the wonderful smooth ride the overall economy leaves me wishing we'd shelled out for a Camry etc. PS.Loaner car during fuel pump was a Sable '05. It was a gas hog also (15mph?!). Ford/Mercury needs to wake up

Title: Safe, Secure & Comfortable
Review:  I had a 1985 Grand Marquis LS and it was great until a 16 year old drunk driver smashed into the driver's side at over 50 mph. The car was totaled, my life was saved.  I now own a 2002 Grand Marquis LS Ultimate, purchased new, and I couldn't be more satisfied with an auto. Gas mileage in town is 21 and on the hwy it's 26, great for a huge engine like the Grand Marquis sports. I feel so safe and comfortable in this car. I just wish the newer models had the same comfortable headrests that my 2002 has in place. I have 90,000 miles on the odometer and the car still drives like it did when it was brand new...still looks great too! A tremendous car for the money!!

It is total junk.  I've already had to replace the exhaust system.  It is basically $22,000 worth of junk.  I will never own another.  That's a promise.  Mercury will fix nothing.  36,000 miles and you own it baby.

Title: Have to trade!
Review:  I've had this car for nearly 3 years and love it..Very comfortable ride and great hwy. mileage (25 mpg).  Only bad thing is town mileage is 12 mpg.  The only thing that has gone wrong with this unit is the heater fan went out.  With the leather interior it's very similiar to the Lincoln..body mounted on same platform.  Purchased this car for $9,000 less than same year Lincoln.  If you're looking for a large comfortable car with great hwy. mileage you won't find better in this price range....Now the sad note....I have to purchase an Expedition 4x4 for my business and we all know what kind of mileage they get.

Title: Not an LS, But An LSE
Review:  I have an LSE, which was available in 2002; bucket seats, center console, 235 hp engine, dual exhaust, handling suspension and 3.27 rear end gearing.  Had a 94 Grand Marquis that was so bulletproof, I bought another Grand Marquis.  This one has been flawless as well, other than the driver's door speaker needs replaced or tightened.  Starts, runs, and drives without any complaints.  The car is much quicker and handles better than the 94, but the exhaust is noisier, the ride is firmer, and the steering much less isolated from the road.  Not sure which I prefer, but the basic goodness is still there.

Title: It's a toss up
Review:  I want to make a few comparisons between this and my '94 Gran Marquis.  Same: Road/Wind noise is too high, especially the windshield when it's raining. Odd huh?  Suspensions: The '02 is MUCH stiffer than the old boat-like ride the '94 has. This would be personal preference for which is better. To me, the '94 is better for highway cruising.  Interior: '02 is more stylish, but some of the items seem to be of cheaper material. I like the '94s button layout better.  Exterior: '02 a bit sportier looking but I prefer the rims on the '94. '02s are very generic looking to me.  Other stuff: Give me a real antenna! The built in one for the '02 just doesn't pick up the signal as well!

The Mercury takes 9.7 seconds to get from o-60 with a v8 engine with 224 HP and the Avalon takes 8.5 seconds with a v6 engine with 210 HP. If you want a big boat go Linclon, Toyota, Lexus, or Acura.  This car has been in the shop ever 40,000 miles.  It has mainly been in the shop for electric problems and loud radding.  Go Toyota Boo Ford!

Title: Missing my Merc
Review:  I had been driving a Buick Park Ave for  the last five years and became spoiled  for a large highway cruiser.  I wanted  to get a Lincoln Towncar (mostly  because, hey, it's a Towncar) but found  that the Grand Marquis was, basically,  a Lincoln for alot less cash.  So far, my only complaints are that it  isn't as quiet as my Buick.  There is  annoying wind noise at highway speeds  that make me want to turn the stereo  up. Also, the factory tires spin on wet  pavement when accelerating moderately  from a stop. Unfortunately, I haven't  driven it in over 10 months since I  have been in Iraq but looking forward  to returning to those smooth leather  seats soon.

Review:  I got my mini one year ago (2017) as a "TOY".  Just for fun, running errands, drive it locally. etc. Keep in mind, the mini was 15yrs old when I got it. The odometer  showed 55,000 but after getting a car-fax, the mini really had 160,000 last time reported in 2015. Now in 2018 I estimate the mini to have close to 200,000.  My mini is still strong, tranny is smooth, changes gears easy, clutch is perfect. I never would have guess the actual mileage to be so high.  It drives so good, I don't use my SUV much any more. I don't know how long it will run without repairs, but for me it's "TOP GEAR"

I argued with my family and friends that if I had to drive a "fuel economy" car it would at least not be generic, so I bought the Mini. To say I have been let down with this car and BMW's backing of this car would be the understatement of the millennium! The transmission went at 42,000 miles and the wanted 7,500 to replace it, even though there were hundreds of similar complaints of faulty tranny's, BMW simply turned its head! Next were the window motors, the end caps of the rain gutters, the exhaust (at over a grand), the power steering pump, and more! This car is the biggest pile of garbage around!

Dealer tells me it's my driving - but I have been driving Beemer stick-shifts my whole life - I never had to have either one of those parts replaced until I got to 175,000. miles.  Furthermore, all maintenance the car needs is very expensive - which may have to do with individual dealerships. Nor am I happy about the acceleration of the car.  It certainly does not compare to any of the 3- series of the BMW's - but then again it's also cheaper.

I just carry a can of flat fixer in case I ever get a flat, which I have not in all the years I've owned it. I always tell people that the mini is not a luxury car, it drives like a sports car.

Title: Slick Ride
Review:  The only negative about this vehicle is that even with the air temp dial at max cool, there is a tremendous amount of warm air coming in through the vent around the petals.  I suspect that the outside air duct must run close to the exhaust and they pick up temperature from that and it is the sent into the car.  To avoid this I engage the interior circulation mode, which eliminated the air flow.  Also, the vehicle does oversteer or plow when making hard turns.It is a very comfortable and enjoyable car for long distance driving.

Title: About My Eclipse
Review:  Drives very well, especially if have driven a manual before. Gas mileage is good 20-21 mpg in the city so far, haven't taken it out on a long drive. If you know how to shift properly you'll get better gas mileage and also know how to down shift to extend life on your brakes. I also have a motorcycle and that has helped me drive a manual transmission better. If you're complaining about your gas mileage it's because you're probably not shifting at the right RPMs. It could have used a few more compartments to place items maybe behind the seats etc.; other then that a very good vehicle. I love my car!!!!!

Title: Fun to drive
Review:  This is the 2nd eclipse that I have owned.  I love this car.  I have had many sporty cars but this car is the most fun to drive.  I love the way it handles corners.  My only criticism is that I wish they could make the front end a little bit sportier.  I love the front of the Mazda RX-8.  I wish this front had more style like that but overall, a hot car that drives great. It's amazing in the snow.  People are always shocked to hear this but it's the truth.  If you want a fun, reliable car, I highly recommend the Eclipse.

Title: Love this car!
Review:  Two weeks ago we traded our 2006 Eclipse GT in on a 2009 Eclipse GT.  I really like the looks of the dual exhaust.  Our old Eclipse had the automatic transmission and this time we opted for the 6-speed standard.  It seems to have so much more power than the automatic.  I don't know if they have made the back window larger, but it seems easier to see behind you when backing.  I feel sure we will enjoy the sun-roof when the weather is nicer and the Rockford-Fosgate stereo absolutely rocks! I love this car and think I'm hooked on Eclipses forever!

The sound system rocks and the heated seats are nice to have this winter. With a 10 inch bass cannon behind the back seat, the neighbors here us when we come and go. Lots of nice features with this car. Cannot comment on long term dependability since our 2012  has only 35,000 miles, but we love it so far.

Review:  do NOT buy this car unless you are a short female. the seats hurt you spinal cord, neck and hips like a mother-fkr! I regret purchasing this car. The looks are great don't get me wrong but the power is horrid with the 4cyl. Everything in the car is ghetto-cheap plastic. What was Mitsubishi thinking???????? My spinal cord hurts now as I type this in my home. The car has destroyed my body. I've seen chiropractors, acupuncturist galore... I have owned the car 5 years and planning on buying an SUV just so my body can heal! I'm really heartbroken w/Mitsubishi. The End. Ps. If you do buy one make sure it's 6cyl and please be short or your body WILL suffer!

Title: Mitsubish Eclipse
Review:  This car was listed as an automatic but it's a stick shift.   It made a horrible noise when I was driving it and the salesman said they'd have the shop look at it.  Although listed with blue tooth, there is no blue tooth.  Although listed with a sun roof, there was no sun roof. The stick shift's numbers were all rubbed off.  The salesman suggested I write them back on.  The car looked well enough cosmetically.  Just minor dings and scratches.  It was just ok, nothing special. The price was listed at one price and I was going to buy it buy they added on over $2000. for I don't remember what.  Bringing the price well over the original price.  When I told them that the price was listed much lower they gave me excuses but refused to lower it so I passed on it.  As I told them, it was a stick shift, when I wanted automatic, there was no blue tooth, so I'd have to change out the radio.  And the car was nothing special to purchase it at the price they wanted.  So I passed.

Title: Love it or hate it
Review:  honestly buying this car was the best thing I've ever done. It's a sports car for somebody who can't afford high-end sports cars. the V6 engines got a lot of power the Transmissions very easy to use and regardless of what you've read on fuel economy I averaged about 22 miles to the gallon. The Hydraulics for the back hatch go out which is expected in hatchbacks. the clear coat on the paint has faded which is also to be expected at that time of painting. and it almost a hundred thousand miles the clutch needs to be replaced. all these things are to be expected from a vehicle that's almost a hundred thousand miles and over 10 years old. altogether if you find one in decent working condition it's well worth the buy.

Title: Driving my Eclipse makes me feel young again
Review:  I bought a 2006 brand new and it has been a great little car. Very dependable and a lot of fun to drive. For a 4 cylinder engine it has a lot of spunk when coupled with my 5 speed transmission. I'm over 6' tall and still have adequate leg room in the front seats. The back seat room is non-existent though. On a positive note the trunk room with the rear seat folded down is big enough to haul some fairly large items. I previously owned 3 other Eclipses: a 1992, a 1995, a 2001 and this one. I'd buy another one but they don't make them anymore.

Title: Amazing Car.
Review:  I had a dark red 06 Eclipse GT with that "rare" black strip going down the front bumper. It was a beautiful car I bought a nice spoiler for it too. It really drove great, I had it from 75 K miles to 115 K miles until it was hit by a drunk driver, totaling it. It gave me small minor problems throughout the time I've had it but that's almost what's to expect from any used car near or over 100 K. My car door sometimes wouldn't close, I had to get it a new battery because the battery I had was very weak.. ect. The sound quality is absolutely magnificent. That speaker in the trunk really gives the overall sound an extra punch. Acceleration is great. I liked nearly everything about this car.

Title: Wicked Awesome Eclipse
Review:  I purchased a 2006 Eclipse GS Automatic with only 60,000 miles on it just last week. It came equipped with the Rockford Fosgate premium stereo system with subwoofer. I'm in love with this car literally. It's a real head turner. Acceleration is fantastic especially when pulling onto the highway or changing lanes, plenty of power to zoom around. The blue colored dash lights are a wicked cool feature. The bucket seats give it that extra sporty feel. The stereo system doesn't come with an AUX input jack unfortunately but I purchased an OEM Mitsubishi cable online so I will install it myself into the rear of the stereo system. Overall I love this car & wouldn't trade it for anything.

Title: eclipse gt
Review:  Ive had my eclipse for 3 months now and it's been a bast to drive! Bought it used with 130 000km on it. Painted the front center black, fake diffuser black to make it look real, and the roof too, and put ralliart badges on. Had no problems with the engine, however... the cheap sh*t door handles did break and even the new ones make that bending plastic quealing noise, the cheap plastic key also broke, and so did the cheap plastic a/c control. But that's why it costs so little, you do get a great 3.8L v6 that could use a little more power if your used to driving high hp vehicles, but if your not its more then enough. It always pulls in any gear with no hesitation but road noise is horrendous!!

Title: Overall A Good Buy
Review:  This is a fun car to drive and a headturner for sure. I have 62K on the car and have had virtually no problems except one big problem.My breaks became spongy after 50K. Since it was past the 5 year warrenty I had to pay for the repairs myself. Bleeding the breaks worked for a few months, then the problem came back. Next, it was thought to be the master cylinder, that was replaced and then the problem came back after a few months. Now all thats left is the booster, which may be faulty. So overall this problem is going to end up costing me over $800.Also outside trim/molding for this car is HORRBle. It was worn out after only 6 1/2 years. Cost to fix? $925

Review:  Okay...I have only had this car for a week. I bought it used with 55k miles. I will update this if I run into any problems, but I am confident that I won't have to. The car looks sweet and turns heads. I took the Eclipse lettering off of the back to create an extra clean look. It is extremely powerful and responsive with acceleration and handling thanks to the 6 speed manual transmission. The RF sound system is one of the best systems I have heard. The car feels sturdy too. No rattles out of the hatchback or anywhere for that matter. The blue instrumental lighting is nice too. As for the person that paid $300 per tire, I found good year 18in tires for $140, and that was brand new.

Title: Awesome Compromise
Review:  I bought my Eclipse used with 17K miles on it. I now have 29K and it has not so much as hiccuped. It's powerful, fun to drive, and I get compliments almost daily. The RF system is AWESOME, best stock system I've ever owned (and there have been many). It's a relatively comfortable ride for a sports car and I've taken it on several long road trips. The backseat is best suited for those under 5'4" but at least it has one. The curb weight gives the car a substantial, safe feel. The stock tires are not as sticky as I'd like in slippery conditions. Probably the main negative point for me is the turning radius. Also, the powerful engine combined with FWD equals major torque steer at times.

Title: Can't wait to sell it
Review:  I bought my Eclipse new and the second week I had a tick in the engine and my exhaust rattled.  The dealer had no explanation for the tick except to change the oil...did nothing.  My CD changer went out in year 3.  The air conditioning controls also went out...the fan works but no cold air except for #1 on the dial. I now also have some loud rubbing noise coming from the back end.  When driving it sounds like something is open as you hear all road noises.  When it rains something in the hatch leaks.  The gas mileage is good however and this car has pep even with the air on (if the air works that is).  This is my first foreign car and will be my last. Mits has made me frown on foreign.

Review:  I bought this car new and recently my car was tied up at a dealership for 4.5 mo. for an input shaft bearing that failed, ruining my input shaft seal, clutch and burned my flywheel. NONE WAS COVERED UNDER THE 10yr/100,000mile powertrain warranty you are supposed to get with the vehicle! The interior is easily marked, scratched. Cheap materials on panels and dash. Gauges are accurate, suspension is ok, I've driven better, and worse for stock. Wheel well gap looks a little funny unless you lower the car or larger rims. I would advise looking at other options or be aware of possible bills with this car. hope this helps.

NOT EVEN AN IPOD JACK (dealer offers an ipod setup for a cheap $230?!)  For a car with its decent performance, the fact tires suck in every way I had to upgrade those too!

The performance of this machine is so fantastic.  When one needs power, there is more than one could hope for in a smaller vehicle.  I have an automatic and can burn rubber when I punch it at 25 miles per hour.  One minor downside is its blind spot, but the mirrors are well designed to compensate.  When one sits in this car and turns on the dynamic sound system, one feels as if one is truly "one" with the vehicle.  I love driving  on winding, country roads..this baby hugs the pavement.

The downside of the 2006 Eclipse GT is that the tires need to be replaced much too soon in comparison to other "Low Pro" enhanced vehicles.What ever happened to 36,000 miles for tire life expectancy?

The 5 speed auto with sportshift is fun to drive, if you leave it in auto mode it shifts fast to provide better speed/acceleration.  Awesome sound system.  Nice leather interior.  Great for someone who just rides themselves or maybe one other person.  For 263 hp the cars gas mileage isn't too bad.  I drive mostly city and I'm getting about 16-17 mpg and probably about 25 on the highway.  That's driving with a lead foot too.  I don't want to get rid of this car because there's not another car on the market that compares to it.  Goes great in the winter as well with the FWD system.

I LIVE in my car (thus the RV part of my title). I drive 130 miles/day round trip to work. 2000-mile roundtrip road trips a couple of times/year, without disappointment; 50000 in 20 months!  It has excellent handling and performance, although difficult to park.  It consistently gets 28 mpg as long as I don't drive like a fool. Seat heat & "vibrating massage" from the 650w speaker are also nice on road trips.  The car is built for one person, although passenger will enjoy seat heat/leg room, but no power seat.

The road/wind noise is also starting to get to me. When you first purchase the car your notice the wheel gap is huge. While on the mitsu posters/commercials there is none. Lower the car to make it look better. I have gotten nothing but compliments for this car. It is great,strong engine, quality seats, and fun to drive but it is not very economical

People think it is nice. The quality of the interior is fairly good. The optional Rockford Fosgate system booms with sound. The ride is comfortable. The steering is nicely weighted. But I hope you don't plan on using that back seat. Only children or small toddlers can tolerate it. I'm over six foot, trust me, you'll go nuts in the back seat. When it comes to cargo time, this car ain't too bad. I hauled a new boxed computer in it and monitor and it fit just right. The car in my opinion is a car that is a looker.

Review:  This is an amazing ride. It handles great and has one of the best safety ratings. Stock, its component sound system is great. I have completely redone new speakers all the way around plus 2 subs which improved the sound, which is great still using the factory head unit. The 4 wheel ABS with front wheel drive is great especially for those tight turns. As for a 2.4L 4 cyl with 162 horses under the hood isn't bad for a stock 4 cyl. Hey the gas mileage is great if you use premium gas. If you use low grade, you will burn gas faster and probably reduce your mpg by 5%. If you want to greatly improve your mpg horsepower and torque do what i did... add a cold air intake & full exhaust.

Title: Outstanding large family van
Review:  With the expected arrival of our 6th child, our Toyota Sienna minivan was going to be too small for our needs. The thought of diving a huge 12-passenger van did not appeal to us. The choices for a long time have pretty much been either Ford or Chevy, which have limited features, and the Mercedes van, while nice, is just too expensive. So we were very pleased to learn that Nissan has started selling 12-passenger vans, at about the same price as the Ford and Chevy vans. When we saw all the options available on the NV, we started to get more excited about it. And after about 2200 miles, we've been very pleased with it. It drives surprisingly well for a large van. I highly recommend the NV.

Title: My 2014 Nissan NVP SL review
Review:  I am very satisfied with my  2014 Nissan NV SL. I use this van for my business deliveries and personal use. Camping, road trips, etc. We dont have any children so I store most of the seats in my warehouse. I wanted the passenger van for the rear air conditioning. We drove our van from Florida to California for a Cross Country trip in 2014. We averaged about 18 mpg. We drove thru a lot of rain and It was a very comfortable and stable vehicle. The V8 Nissan Titan engine is a 500k mile engine. It has been tested many times by delivery and trucking companies. This is why Nissan gives you a 5 year or 100k mile bumper to bumper warranty. Many people are scared about driving this van because of its size. But with front and rear sonar sensors, large mirrors and the back up camera. It is easy to drive. The front and rear sensors also monitor the front and rear sides of the bumpers making it easier to park close to objects. Our Nissan NV is a Tow Monster. It pulls our 5000 pound travel trailer like its not even there. I have plenty of power to pass a vehicle if needed. The 5.6 liter engine produces 317 hp. I have owned Chevy and Ford vans and there were not very comfortable and had little cockpit room. The Nissan NV is the only vehicle made that has the engine forward like a pick up truck giving the driver plenty of room and comfort in the cockpit area. I dont have any negatives to say about my NV. This is a wide vehicle. The only modification I would like to see from Nissan is for them to add amber side mirror marker lights.BTW. I now own a 2016 Nissan NVP SL. Love it.

Title: Not for a family
Review:  I went from a Honda Odyssey to this van since our family grew and we needed more room. we have all the kids in boosters or car seats. Here are the pros:* smooth drive*comfortable driver configurations (however the shift stick gets in the way of adjusting the ac.)* handles the road well* great warranty* people move out of your way and let you into the laneCons:* very wide turn which make it difficult to maneuver in shopping parking lots and carpool lanes at school* Ac has no power in the back since it is such a long run from the front* seats are poorly designed so car seats do not sit well and safely* they claim you can configure the seats in so many ways, but you can't and are limited to a few* essentially it is a truck with seats inside - *the cup holders are on the floor and there is no storage pockets or space so things fly all over the place, *the floors are uneven since they just put down padding in between the runners but once you use the van for a few month the padding starts to cave, * there are not enough car seat anchors so you are limited where you can put them, * the lights are poorly placed, * there is no rear controls for the ac only by the driver, *the seats don't move or recline at all.* there should be a second sliding door for easier access* the v8 drinks gas , I get only about 7-8 miles a gallon (I only have 4k miles on the van)* It is a very high step to get in and out and my little kids keep falling out of the vanThere needs to be a mom involved when they update this van or it won't sell well.

Title: Convertible with out the top down
Review:  Convertible with out the top down Overall I love this car. It is been very reliable and comfortable transportation. However as soon as the warranty expired the convertible top stopped working. The dealer laughed at me when they told me it would cost $13000 lto fix. I feel stuck with a car that has no trade-in value. They said it was the wiring harness and the switch for the convertible top  and that they had to remove the top to fix it and it might not refit and I would have to buy a whole new one.

TOP DOWN is exceptional! comfortable, firm, solid and actually luxurious for a Nissan. Top up, different story. BLIND SPOTS are very bad! Poor design on the rear window. To remedy this I added magnifier mirrors on both sides to help correct the blind side problem. My wife LOVES her car and it is the only one she drives! (she has choices)

Title: Not made for cold weather states
Review:  I live in Philadelphis PA and have issues with the windows not working properly in the colder weather. The windows freeze and do not drop when opening and closing the doors. Therefore I need to start my car for at least 20 minutes in order to close my doors correctly. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and unfortunately I was told there was noting they could do. In conversation I had brought up an auto start, the associate agreed but the dealer does not install auto start and of course would be an expense I would be responsible for. So needless to say I am not happy with my purchase in regards to this issue.

Review:  When the 2011 Cabriolet came out, it garnered horrible reviews. I have watched this different machine through 3 years of a boring lease on another foreign SUV all the time waiting until I could try the Murano Cabriolet. I am now proudly driving my beautiful comfortable 2014 Murano Cabriolet and getting comments like: "Wow, what is it!" "Looks like an SUV on steroids." "Did you sell your house to buy that gorgeous thing?" Easy comfort for 4 people with all the bells and whistles. And, most important, for us old codgers, easy in-and-out which ALL the other convertibles I tried were not. This will probably be my last car purchase and I am sure I will love it for years to come.

After driving it for some 6 months and 12,000 miles, and having made multiple 400 mile trips through both snow and through 100F heat, I absolutely love this car! There are not many AWD convertibles out there, and while it was never meant to be a sports car, this crossover has been everything I could have wanted in an AWD convertible for taking long trips over mountains. The build quality is excellent and I have not experienced any of the difficulties (handling, door weight, etc.) noted in other reviews I read before purchasing. And get used to compliments from truckers and teenagers. It's non stop!

Title: I'm Not Disappointed But ....
Review:  I traded in an SUV and a hard top convertible in the hopes I would be able to have just one car that had the attributes of both.This does, for the most part.As others say, it's either love it or hate it.It clearly is a looker and folks either think its cool or ugly.It's definitely not a performance vehicle, but it doesn't claim to be.It's a very heavy vehicle and back seat access can be a pain, but the good seems to outweigh the bad, so far.It has memory seating so if you set your preferences, it will revert back with a touch of a button.The nav and leather upgraded interior is lovely and comfortable and to me, the only downside is that it requires premium petrol.

Title: 2 Bad Transmissions on the car
Review:  The Rogue was great when I first bought it, until the transmission failed on the highway in 2013. The transmission was replaced under the extended CVT warranty. The transmission then failed a second time this year. Nissan was not helpful in resolving the issue, and asked me to pay $6,000 in repairs for the vehicle. It is not normal for a transmission to go bad after 2 or 3 years and a 7 year old vehicle to require 3 transmissions.

Title: Rogue Scholar
Review:  I bought a used Rogue.  I zeroed in on it for a few reasons.  First, I had a budget and a reliable used car is what I was looking for.  The Rogue was a vehicle that I researched a few years ago.  I like its versatility as an SUV.  I like that it is not too big, not too small, cute looking, handles like a car, there are a few minor vibrations at higher speeds,  but all in all a great deal for the vehicle.  It was in terrific shape, brand new tires brand new front brakes and 7/10 on the rear brakes  with the exception of some scratches that came off with your typical scratch remover and one ding with minor rust that I have a $500 quote to repair (needs body work) and I am planning on keeping it for its second 100K miles.  My son uses it to go to work when home from college, but I'm finding that I'm using it when he's not home to do 70 mile round trip commutes, trips to the cape (250miles)  and even weekend warrior errands.  It has become my go to car when it is available and will be my husband's car during winter snow storms since his car is a RWD.  We had a Nissan xterra that lasted us 200K miles so I'm feeling pretty good about its prospects for reliability.  All in all a great car and a great deal.  It took some getting used to the larger blind spot and the clock is an electronic clock that is starting to fade a bit, but this is a great car despite those two minor issue.  I think I might need a muffler at some point in the future since the original has some rust, but again, I knew what I was getting into buying a car with 94K miles.  So far, no issues at all.  Update. Well I had an axel and fan replaced in August so I spent about 1600 on those repairs. Other than that the car is running good. We have about 103k miles on the car now.

Title: Great little SUV
Review:  Bought this Rogue for my daughter 2 years ago.  It was very well cared for with 95,000 miles.  New brakes, tires, and all scheduled maintenance was done.  We have had no problems (ex a torn axle boot) in 2 years and 22,000 miles.  This is our favorite car (we have 4) as it has a great balance of economy, handling, comfort, and build quality.  The interior is quieter and classier than the CRV or RAV 4.  Plenty of room to move the kids in and out of college.  When I drive the car I average around 27 mpg both city and highway, not bad for an AWD SUV.  The handling/ride combination is good.  The car is quite nimble compared to by 2003 Lexus RX 300.  Ours has all options but for NAV so there is little lacking.  We will consider another used Rogue when one of our other cars needs replaced.  Living in New England the AWD is a must.  I would personally prefer to drive a car over most SUV's but not this Rogue.  I honestly like the car that much.  As of October 2016 now have 131K miles on the car and all is well.  No problems and still drives well.  136K miles and getting a small rumble when first accelerating.  Sounds like a loose heat shield or exhaust item.  Hope it isn't the CVT failing which has been an issue on early production Rogues.  Otherwise still happy with the car.

Title: 2009 Rogue SL
Review:  Bought this car for my daughter a few years ago.It was a one owner with 95,000 miles and a good service history.Have been very pleased with the car.No CVT issues that others have mentioned but it does seem to be an issue on some cars.Better value that the RAV 4 and CRV I looked at.The Rogue interior is considerably more classy and it is quieter inside.All routine maintenance was done before I bought the car (brakes, belts, fluids) so I didn't expect to have any issues and haven't.I drove the car for a few weeks and averaged 27 mpg on back roads with a few stop lights and signs.Pretty good for an AWD SUV and 10 mpg better than my Mazda CX-9.  Update 8/22/2018.  Car now has 147,000 miles.  Still generally happy.  Did have to recently spend $1,500 in repairs.  Oil cooler on CVT was leaking so needed replaced.  Thankfully the dealer said the CVT itself is in good shape.  Also had the belt tensioner pulley replaced.   I suppose it isn't unreasonable to put this kind of $ in a car at 140K miles.  Also the Alternator pulley was chattering so replaced that.  Overall I would say this car has needed more unscheduled maintenance than my Toyotas but far less than my Chevy Equinox.

Initially, I really like what Nissan is about, ride quality, reliability, etc.But I will not purchase another one.Search the net for CVT reviews before you buy.

Title: Rogue can compete with RAV and CRV
Review:  As said above this car can easily compete with a RAV-4 or CRV.I drove my 09 Rogue SL AWD for 85,000 miles without a problem.As with everycar I own.owned I only use Mobil 1 for oil changes at longer intervals than book recommends for the car.Dealer did all my oil changes and maintenance and cost was overall less than expected.Just changed brakes and rotors all the way around with high quality as they old ones started to "wobble" at 83K miles.I averaged 24mpg with mixed driving.I had long highway drives (72 mph) at 29 mpg but also ones at 23 mpg.City driving is less than stated mpg, but overall a great comfy ride. This car is a great all around CUV that will grow on you.Forgot to mention that with winter tires and the capability to engage true 4WD this car is great in the snow.Did trade in the car for a Highlander Hybrid with larger towing capacity.I've been seeing a lot "new" Rogues which are better looking and seem a lot larger, more like what a Murano was in 2008Again you can't go wrong it's just a question of taste.

Or the fact that they think the car is a 4X4. Nissan/Infiniti AWD is one of the best in the world and as a long time Infiniti owner of the M class X series I love there AWD and I live in snow country.We purchased this for my fiance as a baby is on the way and wanted a great MPG Cross over.We look at the Infiniti Cross over but my Fiance didn't like any of the looks and felt it had to many gadgets. So we went with the SL AWD Rogue and she loves it! Great MPG love the CVT tranny fun on highway and holds well in the snow for the high RMPS.

Title: Nissan national & local dealer have forgotten they need a good product & good service to stay in business.
Review:  They are right about the dangers blind spot, although it does help if you have the side mirrors set properly (wide), even then if someone is right behind me it can be difficult to see them.The Blue Tooth works intermintently, but the dealer ship can not find a problem.They believe national Nissan's nonsense that you have to buy a compatible phone.I can go to Walmart & buy a much cheaper Blue Tooth & it works with ALL phones. It is really silly that Nissan think they can keep up testing all the new phones that come out each week for compatibility with their Blue Tooth.

Title: So far, So good!
Review:  I read these reviews and don't understand.Some positive some negative.We have had our Rogue for 2 yrs. currently have about 25,000 miles and it has been a very good reliable car.Never had any problems, just scheduled maintenance. We live in Utah, we have snow, mountains etc. and the AWD is awesome!So far... I highly recommend this car.If you asked me one issue i MIGHT have is the blind spots in the car.The way the back end is formed may make it difficult for a amateur driver.I personally don't mind it, just use your mirrors.Hope this helps.

Title: It grows on you
Review:  I traded in a GMC Envoy because the gas mileage was killing me and I did not really need that big of a car. The interior although well made is plain and simple. The car performs well but I would not call it fun. It is reliable in every respect but there is nothing to get excited about. But after 18 months, it has grown on me as being a very good all around good, practical, safe, comfortable, and reliable transportation.

Title: Not the right car for you?
Review:  You are making a big mistake if u buy this car or should i say "circular shaped car" I thought i was doing the right thing but. i was hardly mistaken. People told me i had the best looking car they ever seen. I heard it all and then when i finally got rid of it then they started telling me the truth. I felt so bad because everyone was talking behind my back about this bubble that i'm driving. Not a good look for a middle age guy with a very important job. Not for nothing but i can't even put up a ceil fan to save my life yet drive this car. make sure you take a second  guess before u just go and buy this "bubble",they call it. Make sure it is the right car for u. Trust me im saving ur life.

Title: My Fixes
Review:  As far as smart key and rear window problems, this helped very much for me. I could not duplicate the key problem for the dealer, but it was getting frustrating. I removed the battery in the controller and bent the 3 contacts up slightly at the folds, using a small pocket knife. It has improved 95% and contribute some to junk in my pocket. I improved my blind spots by installing small rectangular stick on mirrors to my side mirrors. I still look back when I pull out, but it does give you more visibility. I'm 6'2 and I have more leg room than most vehicles. It has rapid response in emergency conditions. For the money, a nice little ride.

Title: AWD Performance Poor
Review:  My purchase was in the spring so in trusting my dealership  to be honest with me as a loyal customer they badly misrepresented  the performance of the AWD feature on the Rogue, I feel it is a high priced  enhanced traction control and as far as AWD in the snow its awful! thanks Ken Ganley Nissan. the AWD engages maybe for a split second if that and you still slide all over the road, live and learn  that sales people only care about the almighty $$ not you as a loyal customer. If you want good, safe performance  in the snow get a AWD vehicle that engages and stays engaged in AWD/ 4x4.It was new to me  so an expensive lesson!

Title: Excellent Choice
Review:  I was trying to buy a CR-V / RAV4 and was not able to get a good deal, so in frustration, went to see the rogue. After test driving it, i was really glad i came to the Nissan dealer. It drove great, looked great, was extremely smooth and quite and the best part, was much cheaper than a similar crv/rav4. After owning a SL with premium package and sunroof, i am glad i purchased. We just love this vehicle, its smooth drive. It averages around 26 - 27 mpg. Great features. Wish it had more trunk space though. Overall, great vehicle

Title: Watch Out from Behind
Review:  I bought my 2009 Rogue S used with 14K miles on it. I had researched it & heard about the rear view issues, but WOW! It is bad. The blind spot on each back corner is a complete design flaw and must be fixed with larger windows in new versions. It's not so much the back window as it is the 2 small side windows. It's a real danger if you ask me, but the rest of the car is fine. I had an 07 Honda CR-V before this one and they're comparable. I don't mind the CVT transmission and feel the car accelerates better than my CR-V did. I have had no issues in these first few months. Gas mileage is great.  AC is COLD, which is nice. The sound system-- the factory version, not Bose--is still good quality.

Title: Giving it back -> lemon
Review:  I'm returning my car on 06/01. Dealer finally settled with me on a lemon case. I had issue with the fuel gauge. It will show half tank when its actually almost empty. I went to dealer ship 5 times. Replaced sensors twice and twice I was treated like crazy. + recalls.  I got so tired of owning not reliable car. I agree with previous postings, the car is good overall, but has too many blind spots. I've managed to handle that issue well, but Nissan needs some improvement in design of the back window. Also, MPG went down to around 20 in the city. oh, well it was hard for me to check as I think I never got accurate reading from the computer. I would not buy this car again.

Some just don't work, but if the dealership you bought your car from is not fixing your car then don't hate the car hate your dealer. I have had nothing but great success with my car. I don't expect it to be all mighty i mean its not a Mercedes or an Audi! Is a crossover mid level SUV. Not the most expensive vehicle you can buy! It's great for getting groceries or hauling the big dog around! Its the best buy in its class in my opinion with the look and feel of all other crossovers.

Review:  After 3 months, noticed transmission noise. Dealer told the noise was normal. Later, car was always stack in PARK position. To drive it, I had to manually unlock the transmission. Dealer replaced the Brack switch, Solenoide and other parts. It took me 4 months to get it fixed. Also, they fixed 3 recalls at the same time. This car is a total waist of $$. Also, rear vision is extremely dangerous. Do not consider this car at all. Nissan needs to review the design of the transmission COMPLETELY. Forgot to mention that I had also to replace the Door mechanism: wet stack in close position in cold weather...

We have not been in the dealer once except for the regular scheduled  maintenance and 3 recalls but all were done at once and during a regular visit so it wasn't a pain at all. This car is very reliable the AWD is great and handles well in snow or rain the ride is pretty comfortable, we take lots of road trips our longest trip was about 450 miles round trip and no problems at all, more room would be nice but it is a crossover.

Title: '09 SL AWD 9 months and rolling
Review:  Overall I'm pretty happy with this vehicle, but no longer quite as ecstatic as I was in the beginning. Within a couple months of driving the trans started making a chattering noise. Dealership replaced the trans. Now they need it for about 3 hours for various recall issues. The Bose stereo sounds like all the sound is focused on front center speaker. The headrest is uncomfortable, and doesn't stay down, always slides back up. The sideview mirrors whistle at higher speeds and gusts of wind. Gas mileage isn't great, but hilly area with 65+ speed limits accounts for that.  On positive note, it rides smooth, accelerates nicely, looks great, handles like a pro, great in inclement weather.

Title: Not bad but terrible sealing
Review:  Overall performances are acceptable. Three major problem. 1. Free penetration of cold air through knobs and buttons due to bad sealing 2. Noisy in wet days due to same reason. But Nissan consider it as normal, which means it is their limitation in technology 3. Very bad rear side-view visibility. You'd be very careful when you try to change lane. There are much wider blind area than any other car due to very bad visibility. I almost hit other car several time in 3 months driving, which I have never experienced before with other cars in my 30 years of spotless driving history. So, not recommended for young drivers.  Minor comment is bad front cup holder design  Overall: Not recommended

Title: Little Bit of Everything
Review:  Was looking and test riding CRVs and RAV 4's.  Stumbled upon the Rougue and found it to be every bit as good as a CRV which I previously owned and better than the Toyota.  Toyota and Honda would not deal but Nissan came down $6K off the list last August and that clinched the deal.  About 12Km now and no complaints other than gas mileage not quite as good as I expected it to be.  Its versatile and fund to drive both in the city and on the highway.  Always admired the looks of the Merano, this shares many of those good looks and makes RAV 4 and CRV look dated.

Review:  Now I understand why all the complaints on this forum about the poor visibility out the rear of these Rogues.  I was backing down my driveway at night and scraped the left rear wheel rim on a low stone wall because I couldn't judge distance properly due to the small rear window. Hope my gas mileage improves. Lowest has been 19.9 and highest is 21.6. Vehicle has less than 2000 miles on it, so I'm hoping for improvement as my mileage increases. Car drives and handles beautifully.

Review:  Have had my Sl Rogue for 2 weeks. The car is fun to drive. I'm getting used to the cvt tranny. I'm coming from a truck so it's a bit different but so far I really like it. The inside is very sporty gray and black. the Bose system is awesome if you love music and blue tooth on steering wheel is a great safety feature, I wish my wife had it in her car. I also drove the Santa fe and Tiguan. Santa Fe was boring but a lot bigger, Tiguan drove nice and had a lot of power for 4 cyl.They are a bit more money and less features though. Hope this helps anyone with making a decision. As note in other reviews there are some bad blind spots. That's my only negative so far in 2 weeks of ownership.

The one we have now also has had electrical problems with the keyless system. The selling dealer has been great but nissan has dropped trhe ball. After 3 times not repaired ( writing this review while waiting in dealership) If not fixed this time want it replaced. we do like the vehicle, averages 27 MPG rides well, handles well on interstate(9455 miles). But will probably not buy another due to 2 for 2 having electrical issues. Like the sound system not so happy with CVT (had a 2007 Maxima with CVT didn't like the trans).

Review:  So, I like others got stuck with the cash for clunkers deal (traded in a Jeep Grand Cherokee) but I have to say that for a last minute choice, I think I did ok.  For starters the engine is loud, really loud.  Almost to the point that I'm waiting for an explosion to happen when I hit 4000 rpm.  Fuel economy is great (considering I went from 16 mpg to 23) and the ride is quite comfortable.  The price, well I still think Nissan could have done better with the S type.  $19000 is a bit much for just about the same stuff you could get in a Sentra.

(I understand now why my insurance went up after I gave up Jeep Liberty for Rogue). That small orange, round shaped computer screen is annoying after a week of looking at it, it's so cheap and like an alien to the rest of dashboard. Suspension is weak to my taste. Lots of road noise when on poor pavement. With high speed and gusty winds vehicle behaves strange least. When you close your door it sounds like something loose inside. Ignition/access key is huge and ugly. Steering wheel, cruise.ctrl buttons, speakers/sound are poor quality. Etc.

Title: Exactly what we wanted, not disappointed
Review:  After studying all the compact SUVs, we decided that the Rogue was just what we needed. It had good mileage (for this class of vehicles) and, in fact, we are getting 26-27 in town and close to 30 on the road. It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage (wildlife surveys, kayak in-putting, etc.). In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway. Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested. Reviewers complain about the storage capacity being less than some of the competitors, but we do not need it and appreciate the better looks and handling of the Rogue. Bigger is not always better. After 4 months and 5K miles, zero defects.

We had an Explorer and while it was a nice vehicle, we really didn't need to be hauling around so much iron.  I have not checked the fuel mileage but the little mileage minder on the trip computer shows an over all average of about 25.4  It is fairly comfortable for a smaller cross over.  I love the exterior design.  It performs adequately for us.  I'm adapting well to the CVT with no up shifting.  I'm well pleased with this vehicle thus far.

I had a lease with Nissan for a Frontier and they took it 3 months early. I have test driven before the basic model hence why not excited to get this. The got me a fully loaded Rogue with leather and everything. The SL is such a difference. I live in the mountains so right off the dealership was from denver to Aspen. It handles great at low speeds and tightens up at higher. really fun with all the technology in there too. I love it and is so much fun inside and out.

Title: Best in Show!
Review:  There is no perfect small suv/crossover. The Rogue holds less cargo than a Forester,has one row of seats less than a Rav4,lacks the visibility of a CRV. However, it is perfect for me. The fit & finish is great, as is the engine. It has 5star crash rating and beats Ford with a stronger roof. In many ways this car is very basic- no leather,compass, or elec.locks. But it has such personality! It has a nice rear,each color pops and looks silky (even those orange ones). The CVT works well and the mini computer helps as well. I had owned a Chrysler product & went back to shop- Patriot, Compass, Liberty are all inferior products as is the Escape,Impreza,& 09Equinox.

The rear window is small but unlike the Toyota there isn't a spare tire in the way or the Honda has three headrests. Any way if you want a perfect car keep looking as they will never exist unless you are a consumer reports fan and then go buy the boring car (CRV) and wish you hadn't but when you get upset grab your copy or CR and tell yourself its reliable !!

Title: Love to drive it
Review:  We have had this car for 3 months and we love it soo much.  We don't drive very much but it seems we always find an excuse to take it for a spin. Car has everything we wanted. Sunroof very easy to use and with the deflector added makes it even better. Like the trip computer as u can keep track of mpg or how many miles u have left before refueling.

Title: What's all the hype about?
Review:  I have read numerous reviews that are all so positive on the Rogue.  I really feel like I am missing something.  I have only had the car 1 week and I am sooo disappointed I REALLY WISH I could take it back!  My main issue is the Huge design flaw (and I believe it's also in the Murano (which really wasn't too much better, slightly bigger, way more $$) the rear windshield is too small!  The back seat headrests block the sides of the rearview window!!!  This "Crossover" drives like a cheapy made compact car.  My other auto is a Sonata and that has a far more quieter, smooth ride.  I did Not expect this auto to ride so rough,my 06 Pathfinder had a smoother ride! Rate this auto a 5 all around.

Title: Just don't like it
Review:  We kind of got duped into this lease.Here's my list  - I'm short and the Rogue has VERY cramped leg room for the drive, it actually makes me a nervous wreck, the head room is also tight & the steering wheel barely tilts. The back seats r also stiff and uncomfortable (and I have the leather package), no adj. head rest(which also block visibility) & no seat adj in the back either. The visibility is HORRID and completely unsafe - the blind spots r huge and the rear headrests coupled w/ a small rear widow leave a tiny square of visibility. No matter if you like how it drives or not, it is simply unsafe to drive. This long time Nissan owner can not WAIT for the lease to end & it's only 1 mo in!

Title: Great SUV for $20K
Review:  Have wanted an SUV for a long time but have driven paid for cars for a while.  Decided to make the jump to a new car (and payment) but I don't drive all that much so didn't want to make a huge investment.  The Rogue gives me the SUV for a reasonable payment.  Handling and styling are great, have hauled 12 bags of mulch in the back with the seats down and could have held more.  VERY satisifed overall.  Need to be a bit cautious on lane changes due to blind spots caused by small side windows towards the back - working on mirror adjustments and not changing lanes as much!  Engine has a lot of oomph and the ride is really smooth.

Title: Great for being the wife's vehicle
Review:  Overall this is a good family vehicle. Meets the same fuel economy that our previous 2003 Altima 2.5S had.  To me there's nothing fantastic but, I'm a sports car fanatic.  The paddle shifters do help with that aspect though.  Also does handle pretty decently for a tall vehicle.  Some of it's braking components and suspension aspects are shared with the Sentra SE- R Spec-V.

Yes, I lose space and some off-road capability (which I did not use much anyway), but the handling is terrific. I feel like I am in a sports car! Now I look for excuses to drive and I can because it uses a lot less gas than my Pathy. I totally recommend this little crossover to anyone who needs utility with a great sporty ride. Buy it for the fun of it!

Title: Transmission Nissan should have a recall
Review:  That the CVT transmissions are junk. You can only buy rebuild kits through Nissan for $5400 parts only. Not including labor to remove and replace or rebuilding. Quotes through a private mechanic starts at $6300. Nissan has an abundant amount of re-manufactured transmissions for $3800 + labor. Makes one wonder if Nissan is trying to cover them selves for a civil suite following a recall.

Review:  I brought the 2012 rogue in 2012 it was brand new 0 miles on it  in 2and a half year my transmission went bad i had only 67000 miles on it. Of course the warranty was for 60000 miles i contacted nissan and they would not repair my car because i went over the miles by 7000 i dont see why my transmission would go bad after that short time. I really think nissan should have at leadt helped me repair my car. Got it fixed and cost me 5500. I will never in my lifetime support nissan ever. I advise people to look elsewhere. Even the company that fixed my car said they don't understand why nissan wouldnt repair my car. No more business from me nissan. Still will never buy nissan again

Title: only 200200 miles on it
Review:  This car has been great for us.  We have only had two issues although expensive issues.  Around 150000 miles we had to replace the a/c compressor and condenser.  My wife came home Tuesday and said we just rolled over to 200000.  Great but when we hit 200200 our transmission went out.  It is hard to complain about only getting 200000 miles out of our vehicle but when we traded or Altima for this, it only had 270000 on it and we had no troubles with it at all.  Hopefully the dealership will treat us good.  Over five years and 200000 miles we still averaged 30 mpg until yesterday morning.

The parts seem not durable vat all,,, Specifically with my Rogue, I needed a new transmission at 98000 miles, and now they say I need a new heater core at 131000 miles. Its a virtual junkmobile! If you do buy one of these, you better get some sort of extended warranty or you'll regret it!

Title: Woulda Coulda been a great car
Review:  First couple of years were good with no problems. Acceleration from a stop is spotty at best. In the summer, it's very sluggish to start, transmission whines. Wife noticed a transmission whine and slipping on a highway trip a few months ago. Took it to AutoNation Nissan Arapahoe where it's had ALL servicing done. I complained about loss of gas mileage, whine, and sluggish starts. They said the transmission was over-filled. What? You're the only place that services this vehicle. No explanation. They also over-fill the tires. Maybe it's their way of trying to get gas mileage up.  With almost 49k miles, I'm worried the CVT is going to give out. The 5 years will be up soon. I do like the car. It's comfortable and pleasant. Took it from Denver to Mt. Rushmore to Billings to Denver that 1st summer, 2012. It was great. MPG was 28+. With a change of tires it's noisier and now MPG is down to 26. Still acceptable, but I'm not liking the trend. Knowing about transmission issues and the lurking ones I might have, I wouldn't recommend it.

Title: Not A Reliable Family or Traveling Vehicle!
Review:  I should have listened to the reviews and my husbands gut feeling. I had previously purchased a 2007 Pontiac G6 from Economy Nissan in Durango, Colorado. Several months after I purchased it the brakes needed to be replaced. Shorly after that the 2007 Pontiac G6 stopped running. Found out it was an O2 Sensor and another issue that Nissan would not fix and stated I would have to go to a dealership that works on Pontiacs. Thank goodness it was under Federal Warranty and I didn't have to pay for the issues that needed to be fixed. After a year or so the vehicle started wobbling. Come to find out three of the rims were bent. I have no idea how. And again they would not fix. Then there were several recalls and I chose to trade it in for another vehicle. Against my better judgement I went back to Economy Nissan and ended up trading it for a 2012 Nissan Rogue. I am paying way more for the vehicle than it's worth for starters. Three months after I purchased the vehicle my family and I were going to Silverton, Colorado for the fourth of July. While going up Coal Bank pass as soon as I hit 10,000 ft elevation I started losing power. With the gas pedal all the way to the floor I barely made it to the halfway point to where my husband had to take off the battery terminal to reset the engine and all the settings. We proceeded to our destination after replacing the battery terminals and the power was restored where we chose to camp and then we're going to go into Silverton to watch the fireworks. Unfortunately, the Rogue would not start. It wouldn't turn over at all. We missed watching the fireworks and ended up waiting til the next day to walk to where we had cell service to call a tow truck to come from Durango. Needless to say it was very frustrating and we had the vehicle dropped off at Economy Nissan to be looked at the following day (Monday). They ran a diagnosis and told us the battery was running half charged. So they fully charged it. We feel this was not the problem at all and they were covering up for a problem they didn't want to fix because the Rogue was 5,000 miles out of warranty. After this event the vehicle lost power a couple of times crossing the highway at about 6,500 ft elevation. Economy Nissan said they could not find the cause for this. On July 4th, 2016, going to Silverton, Colorado in the same place the Rogue lost power going up Coal Bank Pass and would not go past the halfway point. It wouldn't even move in reverse out of the parking lot. I had to push the Rogue backward to get it starting down hill the way we came. The gas pedal was once again to the floor as it was coming up the hill. I made a service appointment for July 11, 2016 for a diagnosis. The results were the module in the transmission was going bad. I was told in not so many words that the whole transmission would need to be replaced for $4,000 for the transmission who knows how much for the labor, etc. And that because it was passed the warranty mileage Nissan wouldn't cover it. So I contacted Consumer Affairs and pleaded my case. After they spoke with Nissan the review was they could not help me because the Rogue is out of warranty. So now, I am stuck with a car that isn't worth what I am paying. Not by half and I feel Nissan knew about this problem. There are many, many bad reviews and Nissan refuses to fix this problem with Nissan. What if the Rogue loses power when crossing a major intersection and I have no control over the steering and I am hit with my grandkids in the car?  Obviously, Nissan doesn't care because all they could say is "I'm sorry, I know it's frustrating. I wished we could help you further." So, with all that being said, DO NOT BUY A NISSAN ROGUE OR ANYTHING FROM ECONOMY NISSAN OF DURANGO, COLORADO !!!

The 2nd Transmission was put in December 2014 with 90,000 miles.Previous years have the same issues with the transmission and Nissan will not own up to the problem with them being made by hand and there is a human error when building the transmission.  I even told them I would pay for the labor if they payed for the transmission.  But they are not changing there mind.  I am about to go drop the car off in Franklin, TN at there office with a TV Crew with me.  Then they may do something when media gets involved.

Title: At 60K miles I need a new transmission
Review:  When i first started car searching for a pre owned car, my dream car was the Nissan Rogue...which was completely out of my price range. I was, at the time, looking for a 5k-8k car....after many failed attempts at purchasing a liable car, I decided to finance a car at Napoli Nissan in Milford CT. Of course, I purchased the Rogue. I was estatic! Loved my choice... A few months into it, it was driving a little weird so I was told it may be my tires. I bought 4 Brand new tires....No big deal. Not long after, the weird feeling came back...brought it back to Napoli...they told me it was my TRANSMISSION....at this point my car only had about 60k miles....Napoli told me it would be costly and advised me to reach out to NISSAN Headquarters for support. MY NISSAN ROGUE IS A 2012 WITH 60K MILES. I reached out to Nissan on several occasion, asking for any financial support - I was turned down because my car was a few miles off of warranty and BECAUSE they said, I never brought my car to NAPOLI for any services... so I was not a "loyal customer' Sorry mam, there's nothing I can do. 25 year old female with a Nissan Rogue for about 6-7 months and in need of new TRANSMISSION... for the record, I got my new tires at NAPOLI, bought it back and left it on 2 different occasions for service needs but SHE CLAIMED i was not a "loyal customer" and therefor, could not be helped.... NISSAN used to be my dream car, not it's just a headache sitting in my sister's driveway because a new transmission will cost me about $3500... I work with under served High school students who read at a grade 3 or 4 level...$3500 is a lot of money that I do not have... especially when I just spent nearly $500 to get new brakes. I bought the car back to Napoli a 3rd time, begging for help...they told me all they could do is trade it in....I have student loans already...they trade in value was crap...they ran my credit 11 times without my permission and I left there with my car and no solution. I have no intention of going back to NAPOLI INDOORs nor do I ever plan on buying another Nissan after getting rid of this...thank you so much.

Title: At 58,000 miles it started to go...
Review:  Bought this 2012 Nissan Rogue SL AWD new in 2012.  It is fully loaded, so the leather seats and 8 speaker Bose Stereo are really nice.  Rear view is obstructed, but has nice cameras all around.  Fun to drive.  I don't notice the 'drone' of the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) that I've read about.  Mileage over the three years I've owned it so far has been OK; 26 combined, high of 30, low of about 20 mpg.  At 58,000 miles - with attention to scheduled maintenance - rust started to form on the hatchback door.  Dealership is fixing it for free.  Also at 58,000 miles I pulled the keyless entry drivers door handle OFF while trying to open it!  Expensive to fix and I was disappointed with the quality of the handle itself.

Title: Discontinued & Even A Better Deal !!!
Review:  Yeah, the Olds line was terminated, but under the skin, it is 99% the same as the GM W-Platform line-up, which included the GrandPrix (Pontiac was also terminated) & Buick Century.  Buick is going no where, it is here to stay, and much of the mechanicals are also shared with Chevy cars.  I bought it cheap, $3,600, 8-9 years ago, knowing it sat (only had 36K miles on it) and needed new rotors, pads and some front end parts.  These all use the Buick/GM 3.8 L L36 OHV V6 & 4T65-E 4-speed AOD, which are about bulletproof!  In fact, the Buick 3.8 L, or 3800 Series II, is the lowest warranty claim engine GM ever sold.  Virtually without modification, that block can be turbo-charged, for a reliable 500+hp.  Mine is a basic model, but it is very comfortable, spacious - GOOD transportation.  There aren't a LOT of them out there, and many people have asked me what it was.  Personally, I think the styling of my Intrigue body is elegant, well proportioned and muscular, with bulging fenders.  It was the only W-body car to get the 12" performance brakes. With good tires (Bridgestone & my FIRST General's, Altimax HP, which are surprisingly good - Thank you TireRack!), the car surprises people with it's very decent handling that would make grandma puke.  Parts?  Mechanical parts will NEVER be a problem, because they are GM parts bin parts, AND, I've gotten any parts I've needed, including grey interior trim parts, window switches, etc., on Ebay, and they were cheap.  Just replaced the CPM, which I bought online, delivered for under $20!  I usually get rid of cars every 8 years or so, but I'm thinking about switching from the 11" brakes to the 12" brakes, the parts look pretty cheap.  I think the dual bar front tower brace (originally for the GrandPrix) will fit and look inexpensive, si I'm thinking about putting in that front tower brace.  My wheels need refinishing (ruined at PepBoys when some numb-nuts sprayed brake cleaner on the clearcoat finish), and keeping it.  Took out the sound attenuator from the air-box, I'm going to get a K&N filter, and eventually, I'm going to have a larger diameter exhaust bent up and a more free flowing muffler installed.  The 4T65-E AOD is ar reliable as you can find too, so, this has been and should continue to be a CHEAP, RELIABLE, GOOD LOOKING, DECENT HANDLING car, and the intake and exhaust mods are not expensive, and should boost pep and mileage.  It's no M%, like a friend of mine bought, but he spends $1-2K EVERY time he takes it to his dealer.  I can fix most things in my driveway.  Told I need new brakes, probably $400+ for all 4 wheels, but I bought a kit with good rotors and ceramic composite pads, AND a tool to compress the caliper pads easier, delivered for just under $250.  I know I can swap them in just under 2 hours.  Like I said, GOOD & CHEAP transportation that does not look like 98% of the cars out there!

Title: Keep in mind
Review:  Discontinued Parts!! Its is a car that was made from 1998-2002 thats 4 years. If internal parts need replaced, its gonna cost a lot and you need 2 of almost everything e.g. : Timing chain guide's. You wont be able to get those from the Dealership as they are discontinued parts. Thats not a bad thing, it just means there isnt a great demand for those parts so they stopped manufacturing them for the  Dealership. Keep in Mind in those rare instances that you do need to replace them, you'll only find them in a kit, you'll need 2 kits ( 1 for each side of the 3.5 L. DOHC V6) Once its fixed I'm sure it will be a great car.

Review:  I am in love with this car. I have the Shortstar 3.5L and it goes fast. I love the way it sounds around 4,000RPM. I love the sound system. Its almost a perfect car. Build quality is eh. But that's what you get when you buy an American car. And the fuel economy isn't where I'd want it to be. I'm averaging 23MPG. 130,000 miles and still running perfect. It's so smooth and refined. It feels like a brand new car. The shifts are so seamless almost like its CVT. The handling is spot on, feels like a European car. But my favorite part, when you're doing about 50 and need to pass, in less than three seconds you're pushing 75. Just downshifts and goes like hell. Really a family car with muscle.

Title: Olds intrigue is Fun to drive, comfortable. 
Review:  I just bought the car used off a random guy off Craigslist for 1,000 bucks a couple months ago.It has issues of course, most minor, some major for a 14 year old car.Just put another 1,000 into it having the rear strut assemblies replaced, new exhaust system, tie rod, alignment, etc. This is all the major work that needed done. The rest is piddly stuff that any old car would need.So for 2,000 bucks I have a car that drives like a 10,000 car. It's got the 3.5L, with 160,000 miles on it. The engine and transmission shift smooth and quiet. The motor has plenty of passing power. Very impressed with the car overall.

I love the sound of the engine, and the feel! She is so easy to drive in the Midwestern snow/ice because she's much heavier than my previous cars.

Review:  I recommended this 99 Intrigue GL 3.5L back in spring 2001 with 27k mi for $13,500 to my parents and they bought it.It hit 100k in 2006 when i last posted and it currently has 137k.They just replaced the A/C condenser so the A/C works now *thank gawd, it's hot this summer!They've also replaced the exhaust system, suspension parts, and a few other minor things.i borrowed the Intrigue recently when my car was in the shop and I have to say this car still feels solid.My 2006 Saab has rattles in the door and which is disappointing for the Saab but impressive for the Intrigue because there isn't a single rattle in the cabin.

Title: If I could, I would buy another one!
Review:  As a car for a first time driver, I would give this car a 5 out of 5. It was safe, easy to handle, hard to dent and not embarrassing to be seen driving. My parents purchased this car in 2007 with 69,501 miles for $5000. Standard maintenance was fairly cheap. The only expensive replacement part was the alternator in 2011 at 120,000 miles. Sadly, I no longer drive it due to accident that hit my front driver's side wheel and ruined the driver's side door. The driverwas going 45mph when they hit me and I walked away without a single scratch. I would totally buy another intrigue if I could!

Title: Waste of Money
Review:  I purchased my Intrigue in April of 2007 and it was the biggest mistake for me. Yes i was impressed because it had a different engine & a rebuilt tranny, but 8mths later the axle shaft broke inside the tranny and had to repair that for 2500k. Not long after i had to repairthe alternator, the computer system, rack & pinion & bushels, crank shaft sensor, radiator, fuel filter. The head light wiring had a short, so i had to replace that every six months. I also had to replace the ignition switch and a year later the same problem. It would not start for 15 minutes then it would. Finally it needed $2500 of repair. Tie rods, hubs, motor mount. After $5,000 into the car already i said no way.

Title: My BLK 199 GLS
Review:  I have a 1999 Oldsmobile GLS, I can't say the car is without flaws, but at 171,000k miles it has been a good car. A good friend has been through two Camry's in the time I've had my Intrigue. It has held up well and still gets' 28mpg's hwy and 22 city. The 3.5L engine is still strong, as long as I keep changing the oil I expect it to go 200k. I also love the front seats, they seem to be simply perfect, I have never been uncomfortable in them. It's still a sharp car after all these years, I don't regret buying it.

Review:  the oldsmobile intrigue is a good car. But it has its downs too. i like this car cause it looks good, it fits 6ft tall adults comfortable in every seat. when someone backed up on me and it was a big jeep and it didnt do anything to my car. and it has lots of power in it, for a big car it tops out at 130 mph. for my car i only had to replace the window motors, blinkers, flywheel, and a oil leak, and thats all. its also good on gas 30 to 35 mpg on highway.

Title: Best Ever
Review:  Bought this former rental with 29,000 on it and have never regretted a minute of ownership.  Repairs have been replacement of turn signal bulbs and driver's side window motor (80,000 mi.) It is a pleasure to drive on highways or twisty back roads. The 3.8 engine is smooth and has never given any trouble.  It's only 195 hp, but always feels stronger.  When it had 80,000 mi. on it, I took it to LA and back (1100+ mi.) and it averaged 31.5 mpg. at Interstate speeds.  Did another 1100 mi. jaunt to AZ five months ago and did almost as well on gas. I've owned them all, foreign and domestic, and this is the best.  GM was nuts to stop production.

Title: My Oldsmobile Intrigue Experience
Review:  This car could well be the unsung hero of the Oldsmobile division. I received this car when my grandmother passed away, and so far, it is the best car I have driven. The car has the 3800 Series 2 (L36) engine, with the 4T65E transmission. The engine can be quiet, or aggressive sounding when wanted, the transmission can shift smoother than my dad's Lexus. I was hit at 25 mph by a truck, and the only thing damaged, was a cracked taillight and an inch scratch on the bumper. This car is the safest, most reliable car I have ever driven. Perfect for a teenager. It is a beautiful car. If I had the money, I would buy another one. Just follow the maintenance schedule, and this car will last 200K+ miles

Title: Mostly great, with a couple issues
Review:  I love this car, I've had it for 8 years and have only had minimum repairs required. One problem is that they seemed to make the power window assemblies poorly. The metal chord attached to a pulley and motor snaps in cold weather. I've replaced 5 in my car. another problem is the vinyl where the passenger airbag is seems to be coming apart. Other than that its a great car. Comfortable, pretty decent gas milage for a 6 cyl, handles very well. If they still made these I'd buy a brand new one.

Title: Do not buy!
Review:  The plastic trim under the doors holds water and the frame rusts. I probably knocked off ten pounds of rust this past week. I get about 15 mpg in the city and 19 maybe 20 mpg on highway. The crankshaft sensor went out after a month or two after I bought it. Friends who have the same car tell me they have to replace theirs about once a year. They cost around $60 so its not an expensive fix but it adds up year after year. The car just wasn't designed very well. Especially for rust. I can't even jack my car up to change a tire because the frame will bend and crack from all the rust. Do not buy. Spend a little more on a better car. Like a Honda. This car is a waste of money

Title: My Favorite Car
Review:  I purchased a 1997 Olds Intrigue GL Basic with no bells and whistles back in 1999. It had been a former rental car with 23K miles, so it had been "well loved". I put over 120K on it myself. 3 years later I found another 1999 Intrigue GLS with low mileage, Leather interior, Bose Stereo, Power seats. I have put over 100K on this car. I had to replace the engine at and rebuild the transmission at 120K.  It was worth the cost, the car is so nice to drive and it really moves! GM really messed up discontinueing this line.

Title: 1999 Plymouth Neon 4 Dr Highline Sedan
Review:  The first 6 years went fine. In 2005 all the problems started, the car stalled half a dozen times between repeated trips to the dealership. They replaced the head gasket, timing belt, starter cables, spark plugs, ignition cables, rear main seal. Finally, they found a faulty relay due to the AC compressor which also was replaced. In Feb 2007 the vehicle would not start. Guess what? They replaced the fuel pump too. I've spend over $5000 in repairs. Now the vehicle stalls intermittently, the engine hesitates and jerks. The hp is gone. Do not buy this vehicle.  It's proof that domestic vehicles are absolute junk. The Neon was so bad it was discontinued after the 2005 model. Nightmare!

Title: Pretty good car
Review:  I bought this Neon as my first car, and as a teenage guy I wasn't sure I wanted such a wimpy car. Well, I have had it over a year now, and I love it to death. I have had two small problems with it, the starter motor gave out, and the power locks are giving out. Other than that, it has been a great car. I love the stock sound system, the 6X9's in the back are awesome, but I did put in a new head unit, and now it sounds even better. I also put new hubcaps on becuase the stock ones where hideous. (the graffiti interior pattern is also very ugly, but seat covers can fix that). Great car if you want to put a little bit of creativity into it.

Title: Not a bad car
Review:  This was my second car ever. Went in, had a fun drive with it, and bought it. Only major issue was the head gasket leak which was caused by a poor design. Replaced the old head gasket with a new MLS one, no problem since. A minor issue was a new valve cover gasket replaced after 75k miles. $30 and 30 minutes in your driveway will take care of this, no big deal. This was my first Neon of two and I plan on buying another. They're fairly common part cars and easy to fix. I love the DOHC engine but the 3-speed automatic can be a slouch at times. Keep up with your oil changes and a Neon will last you a long time.

Title: regretful
Review:  GM says 16/24 mileage,more like 12/19,that's using cruise control, at approximately 70mph never over. It gets even less at 55 mph!what the!? Let up on the gas and it comes to a stop, I mean motor runs but I mean the power just dogs, it's like all power stops going to the drive train? I guess it saves on brakes. It has a horrible turning ratio, didn't notice it on test drive, you need to plan ahead to park. The CD player takes forever to load. If I'd known the gas mileage was going to be this bad, I would've bought a truck or a SUV with 4x4.

Title: 2009 Pontiac Torrent 3.4L V6 AWDI have had a Ponti
Review:  I have had a 2009 Pontiac Torrent AWD 3.4 L V6 since 2010. I get 25-28 MPG highway at 60 mph. I live in the country so for city driving I have less data. Going up steep hills hill MPG can drop to 15 MPG. Minimum MPG is 23-24 with no city driving and various driving terrain. Vehicle has 185,000 miles and gets the same good MPG as new. Car has had a new throttle body, new front transaxle, new timing chain, two new intake manifold pressure sensors, new ERG, new battery, and all fluids, plugs, and filters  changed at recommended times or more often. Brakes are original and will go to ~210,000 miles. The problems I have seen with the car are a lot to front transaxle wear and rear differential wear. I have had to change those lubricants more than recommended. Also had some automatic transmission shifting issues. The transmission seemed not to be able to make up its mind. The dealership said it was OK on test drive so I fixed it myself by installing new intake manifold pressure sensor (first sensor went bad in 2 months so it took another one before problem was solved). I relayed the info to the dealership and they agreed that was the problem. Vehicle drives great in snow and ice, it has all options; Stabilitrac and traction control. Road noise is high. Buy a quiet all weather tire and it will be better. Overall I would buy this vehicle again. I like the AWD snow and ice driving. I have never gotten stuck.

Vehicle: 2009 Pontiac Torrent SUV 4dr SUV (3.4L 6cyl 5A)
Title: Great, reliable car/SUV.
Review:  Sold it. (But loved it and miss it!)Super dependable with a decent ride and nice acceleration. Plenty of room for 5 and lots of cargo space. Rides more like a truck with a stiffer ride. This SUV is very flexible and dependable. It's a great family car, yet can also carry large loads (i.e., equipment, tools, lumber, etc). Have thought about trading it in but its just such a nice utilitarian vehicle that I hate to part with it.Update: Sold the car in January this year (01/2016). It was still in excellent condition, no mechanical issues, no rust, decent (but stiff) ride. Wanted something with a smoother ride for trips around the country. Sold it for $8000 which I felt was pretty good for a 7 year old vehicle. Have been a regular Pontiac owner (Grand Am, G6, Montana, Torrent) and am sooooo disappointed they went out of business.

Title: Driving it until it dies.
Review:  Originally owned a 2007, traded in for a 2009 AWD when I heard they were stopping the line.  I literally walked on the lot, said how much and then started negotiating.  This one rides smoother than the 2007.  I'm 5 feet tall and not only do I feel safer in an SUV, this one isn't so wide that I feel like I'm driving a bus. The AWD really gets me around in almost impassable snow.  We had 13 inches and I didn't have a problem.  I really love this car, mechanically I have not had a single problem at 30k+.  My biggest challenge is where the front end ends, I always have about 12 inches of freedom I don't know about.  Plus, parallel parking isn't tough unless it's a tiny spot. Fuel econ 17/21.

Title: Please don't buy this truck!
Review:  I purchased my 2006 Pontiac Torrent used but 'GM certified' the day after I drove it off the lot I had to take it back for an oil pan seal (luckily the dealer covered that since I had the car less than 24 hours) that was just the beginning and I should have RAN!! I have had this truck 3 years and thus far I have replaced the following: tires, 16 wheel bearings (all by different mechanics to rule out mechanics error), rear end, carrier bearing, CV axles (front and rear), brakes and rotors, 4 alignments (to try and fix the wheel bearing issue), ball joints, control arms, EGR tube, ABS sensor, factory radio (switched for an actermarket as I've heard of sooooo many issues with the factory ones), cruise control, steering column, windshield washer motor, windshield (x3 don't let a pebble hit the glass, ever!), and after JUST putting over a grand in to it not even a month later (which seems to be about the timeline I get in between repairs) the check engine light is on, the alternator is going out, and there is an all too familiar grinding starting back up. I have actually decided to get a second vehicle as this one is in the shop SO MUCH and every time I go to sell it, something else BREAKS and I have to get it repaired. I am not one to beat my vehicles up (I hate paying for repairs!) and this thing STILL is nothing but problems! The interior is also cheaply made as there is paint coming off the door handles and the radio surround. Oh! And the bumper brackets broke about a month after I bought it (and continued to break) so I got innovative and started using cable ties, probably the most reliable part on this entire vehicle!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS VEHICLE AT ALL COST!!!! I've estimated about 8 grand (so far) in repairs and as soon as the check engine light came on it started idling hard (non-permissible content removed)!

Review:  I bought my 2006 Pontiac Torrent in 2009 with only 22k miles on it. The first year and a half, the vehicle was the best that I'd owned. Drove from Memphis, TN to Gatlingburg in the snow, Hattisburg, MS, Meridian, MS, Jonesboro, AR, and Little Rock, AR with no problems. But during my trip to Little Rock, it seemed like I was having trans problems. When I took it to the trans shop, they said it was a speed sensor. Needless to say, the speed sensor kept messing up. I had it replaced 4 times before getting rid of the vehicle. Now, my ex-fiancee's aunt has replaced the trans but the problems persists. And the paint is peeling.

Review:  Until now, I had been very happy with my Torrent which I had purchased less than a year ago.  Although, my recent experience has left me terrified of the vehicle. I been driving for four hours in the middle of the summer when without any warning whatsoever my car had died.  I lost all steering and veered to the side of the road.  A bad alternator had caused the car to die.  Because of this, the power lock doors and windows would not open.  I was trapped inside my Pontiac Torrent midsummer in 37 degree Celsius sun unable to open any doors or windows.  I had learned the hard way there is no emergency release within the vehicle to unlock the doors and car windows.

Only things I didn't like were red lights on dash, and gas gauge ... can't tell when the darned thing's on empty until the gas tank icon lights up!

I asked the dealership how to verify that AWD is operational, said to take it out put it in mud and try to see if it works, GM can't answer this question either. Worried about wheel bearings. Not good work from dealer shop.

Title: Very Good SUV
Review:  Have had the car for 3+ years.  No reliability issues.  Still driving on the original tires, brakes and wheel bearings.  Just drove from Denver to St Louis with ave mileage of 24-25 mpg.  Very good in snow.  Peppy around town but not as much fun to drive as my Honda Accord.  Love the interior room and cargo capacity.  Can haul more than a Jeep Commander.

Title: In the shop a lot!
Review:  I have taken my 2006 Torrent in to get fixed more than i'd like to say. The one that's bothering me the most is that during the past 23,000 miles I have had the bearings replaced 3 times...  this is not normal, correct? It is in the shop right now and since it is no longer under warranty, they will not pay for the bearings to be replaced again. I am so frustrated and do not know what to do.  Any advice?

Title: LAST CHOICE WAS MY 1ST CHOICE!
Review:  I researched & drove so many different auto & in the end, I bought the 06 Torrent!I had originally put it on the top of my list; but dismissed it prior to seeing one. After looking at so many vehicles, it was the Torrent that made me excited when I saw it & drove it! Mine is silver with black heated leather; sun/moonroof, 6cd changer; and many other features that I love.The '06 Torrent rose to the top of my list above the 100's of autos that I had saw.I've owned it for 2 mths & love it! I get 20mpg city driving. It's comfy; easy access to everything; so far so good!  I did buy an extended warrantee for piece of mind.

Title: It's been pricey
Review:  While I enjoy driving this vehicle, its look and comfortable interior, it has been very pricey to maintain this lease.  First two wheel bearings changed were covered under the lease at 20,000 kms.  Remaining 4 on all tires were not.  Have just begun to hear that familiar humming once again that signals another $350 out of my pocket.  The alternator went at 72,000 km for the cost of $1,000, tires were replaced around the same time, along with rotors and brakes.  This spring, the paint began chipping on the drivers side and back and so the whole vehicle will need a paint job.

Title: Love the features of this car
Review:  I fell in love with this car when I first saw it.  It had so many great features on the interior (heated seats, dark fabric, easy wheel mounted controls, temp. display etc...).  I drove the car off the lot, and 7 days later the check if engine light was on.  After numerous "smaller repairs" I noticed a rattling sound and brought it in...the engine needed to be taken out to replace a loose cap inside of it ($3,500) luckily it was covered by warranty.  I absolutely love this car, but it is so unreliable I am trading it in after 6 months.  Now I am also out the $700 I paid for snow tires because of the extended rim size uncommon to other vehicles.

Title: Happy but won't buy American again
Review:  Have owned my Torrent almost 3 years. Over all I have to admit I have been happy with it. I like the roominess, the stereo, and the power. The problems I've had are the right front door speaker had to be replaced, twice. I had to replace the windshield in it, twice. Both times no explanation for why the windshield cracked. Too much flex in the body? Also the remote clicker wouldn't always unlock the car. That seems to be working okay now. The car is nearing the end of it's warranty and I had planned on trading before it expires but the car has depreciated so much that I owe more than it's worth. Now that Pontiac is going away wonder what that will do to the value? My next car will be a Honda

Review:  From 20000 miles until today  I have replaced a total of 5 wheel bearings each and then again the rear passenger side.  I cannot for the life of me figure out what is causing this!  The first two were under warranty the last 3 have cost a whopping $ 400 each incl. labor.  Fortunately today my mechanic gave me a break on the parts and discounted my bill I hope that this is the last that needs replaced but I fear it won't be.

Nothing hit my car. Now it's in my face. My rotors thump and my car won't crank over sometimes. I live in a snowy area and have driven it in the snow but never ever saw the AWD light kick on.

A lot of little problems from sensors that would not allow me to put gas in my car (really!) to a freaked out blower motor that would not turn off. (twice) This summer vacationing at the beach, I was caught in a torrential rainstorm. Noticed a horrible wet smell the next couple of days. Yesterday took Christine to get her washed and water came through the dome lights. From the gearshift. And into the floorboard. Warranty gone! What do I do other than be thankful for the drought in my state.

Per the dealership, I've got a plugged heater core wich is $400-500 to fix. They also have another Torrent in the shop right now with the same problem.  This seems a bit odd to me that 2006 Torrents would start having this problem. Wished it had a 5 year/100,000 warranty. I don't think the 3 year/36,000 covers long enough.

Then things started happening:  A bracket snapped that held something for the emissions system, another emissions problem, two warped rotors, radio on the fritz, heated seat cushion replaced, coolant sludged up, etc.  Each of these was a separate trip to the shop, the Enterprise rent-a-car guy knew me by name.  All within the first couple months of owning this thing (except for the rotors, that was at 17,000 miles, still ridiculous).  The car is nice looking, functional for all my outdoor needs, lots of features, but overall I can't believe how many issues I've had with it. Worst reliability I've ever had in a vehicle.

Title: Worst Car Ever!
Review:  This has to be the biggest lemon I ever bought!  It's now 2 years old and it's been in for service over 10 times starting 6 months after I bought it.  It's been in for reasons ranging from a bad battery to the ignition column locking up.  Each time I take it in service claims it's fixed and each time I have the same issue or a whole new one.  I've called Pontiac and GMC and neither can help me.  I'm now stuck in a car that's been deemed unsafe for another 2 years because it will cost me too much to get out.  I cringe whenever I drive the car and brace myself to deal with service centers.  If you want reliable, go with a Honda.  If you want headaches, buy a GMC or Pontiac.

I have never really struggled with the cargo aspect of the car, and it is a good look inside and out. I love taking this car anywhere (beach, road trips, etc.).  However, I have had trouble starting up the car especially on short trips. Sometimes, it doesn't even start the first (or sometimes second, or third) time! That is outrageous for a brand new car. Granted, I haven't had them look at it yet, but I have heard the same thing from other Torrent drivers. Also, the cup holders cannot be used with the hand break up, which is a pain when you live on a hill.

Review:  I have to say I am glad I got rid of my Torrent. The gas mileage was truly the clincher of me getting rid of the vehicle. The window sticker is not even close to what the true gas mileage is. Had the vehicle for one year, NEVER got over 17 on the HWY, and about 13 in the city! Had many minor problems but annoying after awhile to take in for this and that, and a day without the vehicle, thank god they have courtesy transportation. Right before it was traded in, I had put in 89 octane gas and my engine light came on, I was told by the dealership NOTHING BUT cheap gas as it was a small combustion engine? Very odd issues, but glad its gone!

Review:  We lived in AZ, were moving to VA and needed something for the winter months that could also move a lot of stuff cross-country. The tires are specially made and when we got a flat in Santa Cruze, NM we were stranded for a few days until a new tire came in. It handles well in the snow but the wiper blades are in a well that easily fill with snow and ice requiring you to get out and clean it on dangerous roads. The materials for the interior are very cheap. The turning radius is horrible. Gas mileage is not what they claim. Overall value though is very good and we enjoy it.

Title: It's been good to me so far
Review:  Before buying my Torrent, I also test drove it's Chevy sister, the Equinox. The decision maker was the Equinox had scratchy upholstery while the Torrent's was soft and comfortable. The Torrent has proven to be a comfortable vehicle, even for tall passengers riding in the back seat.  Sharp exterior but the interior could use a touch of class. Three design flaws: (1) I don't smoke, but a removable ashtray should be standard for things like gum wrappers; (2) The CD storage area is not easily accessible; and (3) A wider cargo compartment would have been more beneficial than having the small side storage wells.  No mechanical problems (knock on wood). Nice vehicle and GM offered 0% financing

Title: 2006 Pontiac Torrent
Review:  Overall, the vehicle is a fun SUV to drive. It has 'just enough' power on both the highway and in the city to make short & long trips fun & enjoyable. The vehicle is reliable in most situations and I like the roominess in the interior. The stereo and sound system is nice.  As for the AC, it is about useless in the Las Vegas heat.  Many a times, I simply opened up the windows to cool off rather than tax the AC system.  Passengers in the rear seats cooked.  There is plenty of leg and head room. I have found that the vehicle does not have the much of a turning radius and it has many blind spots; like when backing up or parking. The rear lighting at night from the backup lights is minimal at best

Review:  I owned a Porsche Cayenne for two years and enjoyed it but wanted something with a better balance of power, quickness and supreme handling without giving up sitting up off the road like an SUV offers.  The Macan provides the best driving experience of any car I have ever owned.  The 3.6 L turbo and the standard adaptive suspension make the ride like no other SUV and many 2-door sports cars can’t touch.  The 0-60 in ~4.2 seconds and the ability to masterfully handle curves at higher speeds than you can imagine possible makes every drive an experience.  Beautiful styling in both the interior and exterior.  Porsche has built an amazing high performance vehicle in the Macan Turbo

Title: Forgot I am driving an SUV
Review:  The performance and handling are the obvious reasons for why I got the Macan. But now, after 1300 miles, the experience keeps getting better.  Being 4'11" is always a challenge but the seat and steering wheel easily accomodate me.  And the side mirror doesn't block my view when making left turns - that is not the case in the Audi Q5 which I also considered. I can see all around which was a problem in the BMW X6 which has a rear window that left me with huge blind spots. The best comfort feature is the vented seats.  In a black with black interior, the vented seats cool quickly and keep me cool on hot summer days. The only nit I have is that the Apple Car Play doesnt always turn on when I plug in my iPhone 6. Although it isnt an issue if my husband plugs in his iPhone 6S. I have one warning, it is easy to go very fast and not realize it. 50 feels like 35. 90 feels like 70.  So newbies need to get used to the handling to control themselves...or not!  Took a ride in my friend's Tesla and while the 400hp could do 0-60 in 4 seconds and make. you feel like you sere on a roller coaster, you felt the curves and the car feels looser. My Macan is much better and hugs the curves for better control.     ----having trouble adding in the purchase date so adding it hear: August 2016 bought a 2017.

Title: Best handling SUV on the market still going strong
Review:  It might cost a bit more than the competition but its worth every penny.  My wife thinks it is luxurious and quiet. My kids think its the most comfortable car we owned and my main attraction to the car is its performance and handling.  What kind of black magic is this?!  Porsche tunes their base suspension so well that you will be wasting money on PASM or air suspension.  You won't need it unless you are chasing seconds on a race track.  The S makes plenty power so I wouldn't bother going with the TURBO unless you want to drag race someone all the time.  I would recommend getting at least the BOSE stereo upgrade as the base unit sounds horrible.  I would also recommend getting the sport seat for its superior support and comfort.  If you keep disciplined and not get tempted by all those other options, you can get it at a reasonable price.  I have achieved 29 MPG on the highway at 65 MPH for a 30 minutes stretch.  But it is so much fun getting on the gas and listen to the exhaust pop with the gear change.  The PDK is nothing short of phenomenal.   Your real life mileage will be closer to 20 MPG. Three years in, the car is still a delight. A few recalls have not made any difference to my enjoyment. No unbecoming rattles and shakes. Still have plenty treads on tires and brakes are good for more miles. The Porsche dealers’ pricing for service has gone off the deep end, going from a reasonable $300 for the first service to $1600 for the 30k service. That is basically an oil change and new plugs. Thankfully nothing a local garage cannot handle for a fraction of the cost.  The only dilemma I face is what to replace it with when I sell it.  June 2018 update.  Dealer has learned the errors of its ways.  Whole Service department has be reorganized.  Offering service specials to get its customers back.  Front tires still have 4/32 and rears 6/32.  Will replace after the summer.  Everything still working well.  Still don't see anything in the market which could be a worthwhile replacement.

Title: Sport Sedan in an SUV Body
Review:  I had mixed feelings about buying this car because I had a Lexus RX400h with 105,000 miles on it that was still a perfectly good car. I didn't need a new car, however I was so tired of driving the Lexus. And the difference in driving pleasure of the Porsche vs. Lexus is night and day. The Porsche is an SUV that is actually fun to drive. Great handling and acceleration. And while the Lexus was comfortable, the Porsche feels much more special with higher quality fit and finish. I'm partial to Porsche's based on currently owning a Boxster S and having 911's in the past. The Macan is very bit a Porsche. I also test drove the new Volvo XC90 and BMW X5 before deciding on the Macan S. Both have interiors just as nice as the Macan, and in fact I liked the Volvo interior the best. However neither came close to the driving performance and feel of the Macan S.

Title: Best of Both Worlds: Sports Car and Space
Review:  After owning a Mercedes Benz ML 500 for 6 years, I decided it was time to change. Since we were sort of out of the woods (no more strollers and other junk that the parent of a baby or toddler has to carry around), we were willing to downsize a little bit. We test drove the new ML which was more of the same with a few more bells and whistles and knew that we wanted something different. Something unique. Test drove the Maserati Ghibli and it was very nice but we did not consider buying it; it would have to have been a lease. Considered buying a Porsche Panamera. Test drove the Panamera and I loved the PDK (Porsche Dupple Kupplung; double clutch) transmission. Very smooth, quick, and responsive gear changes. But the Panamera felt like a boat and the standard 6 cylinder did not have enough juice. I read about Macan and began to really research it and decided to take one for a test drive at work and I was sold on the spot. I had just bought a 911 at that time and the Macan felt like a 4 door 911. Took the wife to the dealership for a test drive and she loved it as well. I also test drove the Cayenne. The Cayenne felt more like the ML - felt heavy and wasn't peppy. We ordered the Macan around Holloween and got it March of this year.After 6 months of ownership I cannot find a single flaw with the car. It is amazing in every way. It is very responsive and agile. It handles really well. The PDK transmission is very smooth and shifts great and has real paddle shifters instead of those terrible buttons. Switch it into sport mode and the transmission shifts are even quicker and the entire responsiveness of the car is even better. I truely feel like this car is a 4 door 911. There is also plenty of space for luggage for those trips to the beach and/or for going out of town. I've heard some complaints about the rear seat knee room, but everything has a price in my opinion and there has to be a compromise somewhere between sportiness and space which in concept are opposing principles.

Title: Safety First - He ran a red light!
Review:  My wife and I along with some friends thought we go see some interesting art yesterdat.  Less than a mile from the house, we were hit on the driver side by a PU that was going about 45-50mph.  He never touched his brakes from what I can tell.  My view was block by another vehicle but I did see catch him out of the side of my eye right before impact and was able to swerve a little.  Both side impact bags deployed and surprisingly, no glass was broken.  It spun us in a complete 360.  The vehicle did what it was design to do and there was no intrusion into the passenger cabin however the truck did do a number on the left rear tire and wheel. The only injury was to the occupant in the rear passenger seat suffering 6 fractured ribs from the seat belt, but I'll take that any day.  I haven't inspected the vehicle but I'll bet that it's totaled.  This accident happened so fast that none of the passengers were able to brace.  I  am very pleased with how it did with this impact to the driver's side passenger door albeit not a Tbone.  I understand from the Euro safety test that the Macan got good grades and that was proved up this Sept 5th.  If anyone wants pictures, I have some.

Review:  For the most part I love my new Macan. It was what I was looking for in the way of  sportiness and practicality after having a Mercedes CLS that couldn't handle the bad roads of Houston. In sport mode it is engaging and quick but in traffic I just drive in comfort mode. Perfect size and easy to park.   Only problem so far is my Sat radio function stopped working after 4 days and I have been waiting over 2 months for a replacement. Pretty disappointed that Porsche has not fixed this yet but hopefully soon.   Getting about 21MPG combined so far.

Title: My 22nd new vehicle
Review:  My Macan S is by far the most enjoyable new car in my long car-buying history. I have purchased Ford, Olds, Nissan, Toyotas, Honda, Acuras, Infiniti, BMWs, but not since my '98 E36 M3 have I been so thoroughly impressed with a car. Great handling PLUS great ride, solid, quiet (almost too quiet), fast, plus much better mpg than I expected (23.8 @ 2600 miles)...I make up excuses to go places just to drive this car. Didn't rate reliability because it's new & my 1st Porsche. Came from '08 and '10 MDX, & was going to try X-3 35i until the Macan info came out in January. Picked mine up in May.8/16 Update:Still love this car at 2+ years and 27K miles. 100% trouble-free (only few software updates). Got over 25mpg on recent road trip. Still solid and rattle-free. Only "negatives" would be reg maintenance cost (i.g. oil changes) overpriced. And the sun visors could be a little larger.Update:At 40 months, still my favorite new purchase. Had 2 recalls handled with a morning visit, but zero problems to date. Still drives like new. Great exhaust sound.  Usually get "new car bug" at 3 years. Recent test drives of new competition leave me unimpressed (except for new Panamera 4S which is out of my $ range). I check trade-in value every year (avg. of KBB, Black book, Edmunds, NADA), and residuals are extremely high. $about $14.5K depreciation for 36 mos, 35K miles. Outstanding.

Title: INCREDIBLE VALUE
Review:  I am an appliance repair(wo)man. Bought the van new 3 years ago. 80k later, I've changed the front brakes and tires once. Although I change the oil every 3k to 4k miles, the book says every 8k. The acceleration is like a race car, even fully loaded to the brim with parts and tools. It goes from -0- to zoom in a few fast seconds. With sliding doors on each side, and a rear hatch, all my parts and tools are easily accessible. There are no rear windows, but the back-up camera works very well. I trust dodge to build a reliable van, and have never....never....been let down. Since 1995, and 4 hard-ridden vehicles later, i've always sold them at about 250k, with no major repairs. I paid 16.5 k, brand new....put 500.00 in shelving, and on the road we went. Peace of mind is priceless. Can't wait to see what they add in 2016! Built in wifi and a tablet station would be very usefull....add a printer into the dash, and you'd have the best service vehicle in history. Thanks again for keeping the faith!

Title: Perfect van for service technicians
Review:  I just got the C/V as a company vehicle about a month ago. Coming from a Ford Transit, this vehicle is like riding on a cloud...a quick cloud! And I no longer feel like I'm going to get run over while trying to merge onto the freeway. The "expert review" that said the Transit is more comfortable  around town is completely inaccurate. Comparing the Transit or NV200 to a Ram C/V isn't even fair...to Ford, Nissan or Chrysler. Any employee or other person travelling from site to site all day is going to be way happier in the C/V...and a lot safer than in a Transit or NV200. The C/V is smooth, powerful, has power everything and ample space for tools/equipment. Even the stock sound system isn't bad for what it is. Ok, 75000 miles later :Cons: The side mirrors have terrible blind spots. They could be better. Invest in some small stick-on blind spot  mirrors. The spare tire could be located in a better spot. Other than that, still a great vehicle for service technicians. Very disappointed that Ram discontinued the model.

Title: As great in 2012 as it was in '97
Review:  I actually have the automatic, which I bought in the name of practicality because I live in Los Angeles and I sit in hours of traffic every week -- but since buying the car, I half-wish I had a stick because this car is so much fun to drive. Originally from MA, the car's undercarriage rusted significantly before I bought it, which has caused a dearth of minor(ish) problems. Though, in the car's defense, none that you wouldn't expect to see on a 17-year-old vehicle with mostly original equipment. I have taken it from 82K miles a couple of years ago to about 107K today without any major repairs. Build quality, especially where the interior is concerned, is a bit lacking.

Highway mileage driving at 75+ MPH is 28/29, well beyond original rating.  I have put tires on it every 60-80K, oil every 5-6K, and exhaust systems every 70-90K.  Beyond these, only a fuel pump and two clutches and scheduled maintenance.  The best and still running like a top.

Review:  This has been one of the best cars that I've ever owned. Heavy enough to be safe on highways, steady enough to not even bounce when side-swiped, reasonable on fuel and the hatch back has been indispensable. I've loved this car. The 1st transmission failed at 49K, but it was replaced (free) with a re-built and we've had no problems. The gasket heads got a little leaky last year but we've got everything under control. I've made a few major repairs thru Saab which is costly but we wanted to be sure we weren't using poor replacement parts. We finished all minor repairs and tune ups at a good local service garage.

Title: 1997 CS Automatic (modified) - Amazing!
Review:  I bought this car 1 yr ago for $2.5k. Since then I have put $3k into it: new motor mounts, Bilstein HD shocks, front bushings, new CV boots, a 3" downpipe, 7" wide wheels with 225/15 Dunlops, a Stage 3 ECU which converted the LPT to FPT and remapped the computer software.  The car was 170 Hp and handled well. Now it screams at 270 Hp, spins the wheels off the line and in 2d, goes from 50-85 mph in a snap, and can blow past any BMW, Lexus, etc, on the road.  I can throw it into corners like a sports car, and it never slips.  BUY THIS CAR! It can be turned into a monster! The 2.3l turbo can be tuned to over 400 Hp. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing

Review:  I went from a Porsche 911 into this car, so I was a bit dismayed at the boat-like handling at first.  But I have owned it now for almost 2 yrs and haven't had to do anything other than change fluids.  Saab has built a vault- like car here, and it has more space than most of my friend's SUVs with much better fuel economy.  I'm not crazy about the styling and handling, but it has plenty of power, especially down low in the torque band.  The car does 0-30 faster than my girlfriend's Subaru WRX.  These cars are just incredible value for the dollar.  The car cost more than 40K new in 1997, and I bought it for 5K in 2005.

It was a very comfortable ride with no problems. The fuel is awesome with cruise control on.  Maintenance: new rotors and brakes. New battery. New hub and bearing both sides. New outer boot and halfshaft both sides (if you're changing the outer boot, also change the halfshaft. You can get that in one piece.) I did the work myself. Saved around a thousand. The first side is hard but the second one is a breeze because you know how to do it at that point. I wanted to do the whole front end over. Next I am going to put in new engine mounts. Easy!!

First comment is that  it is huge, seats 5 adults no problem.  2.3 ltr turbo is quiet but powerful,  and the overall road handling is great.  A bit of a gass gossler and loaded with  lots of electronic gizmos that all seem  to need service at 60,000 miles.  The  car is a bit expensive for upkeep - but  a real pleasure on road trips.  A far  better value than a BMW 3 series  probably more spacious than a 5 series.  A great first time buyers entry in to  the near/luxury sedan market.  Buy the  car, drive it, enjoy it and worry about  the rest later.

Comfortable for distances.The cargo space is more than enough. I've fit all of my camping equipment in this car (tent too). I can also comfortably fit my upright bass. As for aesthetics, the interior is dated, though still nice. No glovebox, but door pockets + pouch in passenger leg area are ample. Exterior is old, but I happen to like 80s design.

Each time they said they had it fixed and alas, it is now out of warranty and still pops.Oh, and the service engine light came on about 2000 miles after warranty expired. The computer code shows the catalytic converter is not functioning properly. Now my transmission is slipping horribly. Fluid is clean and has always been full. This van has not been driven hard or fast. It is simply a lemon and from looking at the other reviews, it is not alone in it's misery.

Title: Not 100% happy
Review:  Like many others, our Relay has been in for repairs numerous times.  From the beginning it doesn't want to start at times.  Now that warranty is expired they found problem. Imagine that!  We don't have the problem with the molding like others, but it has been in for the brakes, sway bar, rear upper light, back seat pull broke, air vent broke (all plastic on it is cheap) shortly after purchase. Gets better gas mileage than others reported, but we set cruise at 65mph. Hwy mpg is about 28-30. Seats are difficult to get out.  Otherwise, it's a good vehicle.

Title: Not so happy 
Review:  We have owned our Saturn for 9 months now and are not satisfied. We have been in and out of the dealership with so many problems : electrical ( abs and traction tire system needed to be serviced every other 3 weeks)  front tires squeal like a 50 year old car. The darn car beeps at you for no reason while driving down the road. The engine light goes on and off and dealership can't find a problem. Lost cruise control while driving on freeway, just cruising along and bang lost speed no warning just shut itself off. So not happy wish we could get rid of it.

Title: Always Reliable
Review:  My 4th Saturn, I pulled a 3000 pound trailer from MD to AK via FL and AZ. Driven in 117 degree AZ and -23 degree AK. Always starts always works. Handles 12" fresh snow with no problem.  Goes on ice, but doesn't like to stop or change direction, so go slow. Kids love the interior. Used the OnStar phone when we couldn't get cell signal in back country. I got 12 MPG towing 3000 lbs. I get 23 on mountain highway with no trailer and light load. 16 mpg in town. 14 mpg in snow in town. Continental tires were lousy. Have michelins now and they seem to be lasting well. Have had only one dealer needed repair and they covered it for free even though the warranty had expired by 2k miles.

Title: Do NOT Purchase this vehicle
Review:  I have had this van for almost 2 years now and it currently is in the shop for the 5th time. The driver door is always broken and you cannot drive the van with less than a half a tank of gas on an incline - the fuel cannot get to the engine and the car dies or will not start if parked.   I've had a rental for over a week and was just given a document from gm stating they couldn't fix the problem - it's "just the way the car was designed" and that I would have to live with it.  Very unreliable, interior plastic is cheap and breaks, the brakes squeal constantly, I had to replace tires at 15k.  Horrible gas mileage - about 15 mpg!

Title: The good and not so good
Review:  We wanted a van and chose a Saturn based on the design and performance of the 3 Saturns we owned previously. While we really like the interior design and economy (avg 26 hwy) it seems this may have been rushed to market without adequate testing. There is a howl that eminates from the windshield at highway speed that can't be resolved, moulding and interior trim have simply fallen off, the automatic door won't close for no apparent reason(not good in a Michigan winter), there seem to be random rough idle issues.  No breakdowns but just not the level of quality we had experienced previously and come to expect. We won't buy GM again.

Title: 2006 Relay on the road
Review:  This is our fourth Saturn vehicle.  We had 2 sport coupes and a 4 door and needed a van.  Purchased as a good overall value, we got this van with 1,500 miles for what we would have paid for the "leading minivan" with 70k miles.  It rides and performs well and gets good mileage for a vehicle its size.  Here about 1 year and 30k later we have some minor fit and finish issues.  It's fairly loud at highway speed, there's an annoying windshield howl at 70mph, experienced by a fellow Relay owner as well, some weatherstrip is already coming loose and I have had a minor transmission slip.  Hopefully it will hold up a bit better over the long haul.  Like the design, just seems the assembly is sloppy.

Title: Could be better
Review:  Our Relay has been a vehicle that our children have come to love with the built in DVD player.  We couldn't go anywhere without it.  It is a smooth ride with a few bugs that need to be worked out.  The molding has a problem with sticking to the vehicle.  Our tires (Continentals) were worn to the wires after 11,000 miles.  The automatic sliding passenger door pops when closing.  Other than that we really like the vehicle.  OnStar is not the best thing if you dont live in the city.  Have tried using it when things go wrong with the vehicle and they cannot get the contracted towing companies to come out to give us a tow.  The first year service is ok for free but we would not pay for OnStar.

Review:  The Relay 3 was the perfect minivan for us. As a disabled veteran a wheelchair, so we needed something with a lot of room but did not want a full sized van. The interior is very roomy, it comes standard with a DVD player and a 120 outlet in the back. Ours had the entertainment package & came with 2 wireless headphones as well. The center & backrow seats and toy box, lift out very easily, and there is tons of storage. Driving the Relay has been refreshing as well. It handles extremely well and has fantastic pickup. I highly recommend the Relay to everyone looking for an affordable minivan with lots of room, tons of standard features, and is fun to drive.

Review:  This is the worse van on the market. GM designed this in 2005????? It reminds me of a mid 1990's Chyrsler. It's heavy, seats weigh a ton, under powered -- it's a dog with the 3.5 slow.... Forgrt about the power doors - pull fuse 21, or your batterey will drain every 2 days. The air Conditioning is terrible - with a full charge. My instrument panel looks like Christmas - abs warning - gas cap warning - service light is on - Too much to list . Oh, the gas mileage - 15 mpg overall - take out all the seats - I swear they weigh a 100 pounds each - and you  will average 16 mpg. DO NOT BY A RELAY< UPLANDER< MOUNTAINER< OR THE BUICK version. I really believe GM stoped caring and went so cheap with this one. Seats wear and crack after the first year. Gm is doing well now - maybe 2008 - they almost lost the ship - woke them up.

Title: Drive - this is the best for 30 grand!
Review:  This is a true sports car by design and engineering. As the first new RWD sports coupe since the late '80's from Japan reveals a classic sports design that is an eye catcher to others on the road. It has enough power to maneuver without fear of failing on very twisty country roads. For example, I can woosh through a curve marked 15 mph at 45 mph or more. When it comes to stop, it stops as the brakes do not fade. I have not enjoyed a sports car like this one since I purchased a pocket rocket Eclipse back in 1993. This car has style, creature comfort, and driver confidence built in. The boxer engine is a real plus. Some argue this car needs more power but I am not convinced. Any great driver knows how to max out a well designed car regardless of engineering limitations. To say otherwise is just plain lame. Besides, why lose fuel economy with a larger engine when the average speed out of red light is proportional to someone else's car? Forget dragster with this care. Embrace true sports car driving instead. After all, it remains stable through turns and a dragster does not, This car is all about balance and fun.

Review:  We wanted a great car to drive around the country. Our last sports car, a Chrysler Crossfire was perfect. We checked out a Miata and a Fiat Spyder, but there was just not enough trunk space. This Scion FR-S was perfect. Plenty of room. Great handling. 35 miles per gallon on the highway. And, since it was a new 2015, the dealer had it priced with a discount of $3000!Well, we've had the car for a year now, and I'm still very happy with it. I'm pleasantly surprised by the gasoline mileage - I average over 30 miles per gallon with every fill-up. The car has been rock solid in reliability. I've taken advantage of the ToyotaCare free maintenance - no cost oil and filter changes and tire rotations every 7500 miles. I'll be going in for the 15000 mile check up in about a month. Very happy with the Scion FR-S!

Title: Reliable, Fun
Review:  Scion FRS known for you JDM fanatics like myself included as Toyota 86, really pays homage to the true meaning of a sports car not just based on 0-60 but RWD, great handling, brakes, suspension. Sure it won't be 0-60 fast like the Mustangs, Challengers, Camaro but the car itself is truly engaging to drive whether or not it's a automatic or manual it may not be everyone's cup of tea but this car doesn't pretend to be. The way the automatic is programmed is truly different experience from ones I've driven and to note I've driven many MT cars from Civic SI, Celica GT, MK3 Supra, it gets the job done especially if you intend to daily drive this car, now if your gonna track the heck out of this then MT might suit you more. Make sure you have on sport mode and sport trac to get the most of the paddle shifters. To really appreciate this car you really need to drive it and I've been more than satisfied to what the designers and engineers did. There's thousands of ways to mod and customize this car as well but for me the HIDS with LED, rebadge, drop in intake was all that it needs.

Title: FR-S Great bang for your buck
Review:  This car isn't a rocket. It's a drifting, handling demon. If you want to go to the track and eat Mustangs, move on. You won't win. But if you want to have tremendous fun on corners, and a lively ride in traffic, this definitely is a car to consider.Yes, it's a bit underpowered acceleration-wise. You have to know that going in. And don't even consider automatic - 6-speed all the way or go home. That said, it is SO much fun to whip around traffic, take 90-degree turns at 50mph+, etc. It corners like a dream and is incredibly responsive. It's just a fun car.Also, it's a 2-seater. It may have four seats, but unless your friends are quad-amputees or children, they won't fit in the back. This is purely a 2-person cruising machine. The only way it would be more fun is if they made it a convertible.I have an hour-commute each way every day to work, and it puts a smile on my face every time I get in it. I have no regrets buying it.Edit 2 years later: I still love this cat for my daily driver. It is agile, small, but not Miata-small, you know? And while I will never win races in it, the handling on it is everything you could want from even a Porsche-level car. Definitely a keeper.I would recommend the Subaru BRZ over the Toyota however. The interior is much nicer, the service/warrantee better, and the price more or less the same.

Title: Do not buy the Scion FRS - you will regret it
Review:  I've had nothing but problems with this car. While idling, the car emits a high pitched chirping noise which is annoying and embarrassing coming out of a "sports" car. There are many complaints online about this; over 85% of owners say that have this problem. The driver side window squeaks when sliding up. The leather is cheap and gets destroyed when rubbed while trying to enter the car. In regards to performance, I knew the car had 200 hp before I purchased it but, wow, it is freaking slow! Yes the handling is amazing but the cheap stock tires will slide the car everywhere. And don't even think about racing the car next to you on the green light; a standard sedan is faster than this car.I complained to the dealership and to Toyota Motor Sales about the chirping noise. They have a technical service bulletin that states this noise is an ABNORMAL noise yet they will tell you to your face that it's a normal characteristic of the car.If you go to a dealership with interest in the FRS, they will not tell you about the chirping noise. They are deceptive but hey, it's a dealership right?

Review:  This is my daily driver and this puts a smile on my face every day (even after a year of ownership).  Handling is amazing!  It is definitely quick, yes straight line performance numbers doesnt do this car justice.  It is fast through the corners and if you manage the RPMS to stay in the power band it will not disappoint.  Some negatives: passengers riding on the highway have complained about a rougher ride (think sports suspension) and there is wind and road noise (I still have crappy stock tires on it, which adds to it).  Get behind the wheel and you will never be bothered by any of this.  This car is more than numbers, it has that enjoyment factor that cant be measured.

Title: A real drivers car
Review:  Look at the videos of Matt Farah or Chris Harris driving various modified and unmodified versions of this car,  which is the same car as the Subaru BRZ or Toyota 86.     Or my favorite review by the German reviewer Thomas Hellmanzik who is part of the youtube channel Everyday Driver,  published Aug 3 2017.     This car is not for everyone,   but it is definitely going to be appreciated by a certain group of drivers who might also like the Miata/MX-5 but want a real coupe.     I've had a Miata and the FRS is a better highway car and a better mountain car in my opinion.     The car is a little bit boring in casual driving,    for everyday trips I often take a lazier kind of car or pick up truck,    but probably because I am a little older and like my creature comforts if the roads are not exciting.    But if you have the shifting skills to keep this car in its power band above 4500 rpm and the right roads,   this car can absolutely blow your mind and give you a driving experience far beyond the price they are asking for it,   especially used.    Its low,   small,  lightweight and extremely rewarding and capable all the way to the limit,   while also being very predictable and tactile.     Its pretty loud,   and somewhat cramped.     I consider it a better more modern version of the old Datsun 240z.

Review:  Since I have owned this car, the battery died within the first year, random pieces of plastic have fallen off, it has had numerous transmission "software" problems that have left me stranded and ready to walk away from it, the engine blew at 23,000 miles, AND NOW it has yet ANOTHER transmission problem that the service department can't figure out -- I can't get it to shift out of Park when it is cold! THIS IS A PROBLEM! I tell everyone I see when I am at the dealership, I tell everyone that ever asks me about it. The guy in the parts department even agreed with me: "Yeah, I have never heard of a car having that many problems in that combination."

Review:  Really disappointed with this car.  Yes it's fun to drive, great to put the top down, and yes its cute- however when I went to trade it in- it turns out that a dealer buy back = LEMON in the car world.  Thus- hideous trade in value.  Shame on you Annapolis Smart- Mercedes.  Buy back = Lemon- run don't walk from the 2008- check the title history, if you see dealer buy back look elsewhere unless you plan on keeping it forever.

Review:  Being my 2nd Subaru, I amglad this one isn't the SVX. I LOVE this one, its great inthe bends, a little on slow side w/out turbo but keeping rpm's up compensates fine for "in the city" driving if you feel the need. I have slight leak at 60k miles on my heads. As it seems to be known issue, I am displeased SOA has not done something to correct issue withthe customers. as long as I get too 100k ill do head gaskets, water pump and belt @ same time. till then just keeping the oil changed.

Title: Decent car but beware
Review:  I've had our 2006 Baja for almost four years now.  While I do wish it was a Turbo (the car is too heavy for the engine to accelerate at a decent rate), it drives very well and is very predictable in bad weather and conditions.  The styling is pretty cool, and the AWD is great when it snows. However, my engine has a head gasket leak.  Yep, at 70,000 miles - both heads are leaking oil.  It's not a huge issue right now, as the leak is very minor, but still the dealer wants $1500 for it.  Same price as the other guy - I wonder if we have the same dealer?  Who knows, but it's still annoying and therefore I will not recommend Subaru to anyone until I know that this issue is resolved.

Title: Fun Little Truck
Review:  When I was looking to replace my V8 Dodge Dakota, checked every dealership within 50 miles. Nothing really caught my eye. I really wanted something that would be more like my 1981 Volkswagen Rabbit Pickup (size-wise)  This is my 1st Subaru and I was kind of apprehensive. But, after less than a year, I am wondering why I have not owned a Subaru before. In the snow, this thing handles very predictably.  The turbo offers the very best of both worlds... 4cylinder economy most of the time with the kick in the rear of a 6cylinder when you want it. The first time I pinned my wife to the seat accelerating onto the interstate was pure pleasure. (for me,anyway)

Title: Build these again!!
Review:  When our 03 Baja was getting high miles, there was only 1 choice to replace it - another Baja! We found our 06 6 hours from our home still under factory warranty. The only complaint I have about the Baja is SOA didn't keep making them based on the new Outback.  Comfortable, capable off road, great in the snow - what more could anyone want from a daily driver?  If you don't need the towing capacity of a full size truck and still want decent gas mileage with a truck bed (plywood and drywall as well as dimensional lumber fits), the Baja is your vehicle!  If SOA had advertised them, they would have sold like hot cakes. 3 people bought 1 after seeing our 03.

I have hauled a big freezer, a washer & dryer set (whole set at once!), even hauled a riding mower home from Sears. The mower barely fit, but due to the width of the Baja's bed I was able to accomodate it. It's awesome in the snow and mud and I have yet to get it stuck.

I'd trade-off the loss of a little pickup and a 6' bed for the all wheel drive/better handling, great standard features (fog lights, power moonroof, ski rack, bed extender, etc.) to save 30% on the gas bill any day! This vehicle is a great downsizing option. Subaru may want to re-think their decision to stop making them before a competitor does.

Title: Keep it away from the dealership!
Review:  I bought this Baja to save gas over my Chev full size pick-up. WRONG MOVE. At first it got really great mileage (almost 30 mpg on hwy) but then I took it to the dealer for its first oil change. BIG BIG MISTAKE. After that day it starting getting 17 mpg in town and 20 mpg on hwy. I took it back to the dealer (02/07) and the mechanic said no codes showed bad and therefore he couldn't work on the vehicle. The dealer offered me $18k trade in for a new Chevy truck and I guess that's about the best I can expect to get. Such a great concept vehicle but I can see now why Subaru never sold very many of them. Why drive a tiny truck if it uses as much fuel as a comfortable one? Save your money!

I traded in a 2004 VW Touareg V8 and do not regret my decision whatsoever. It is much funner to drive than the Touareg and is just as comfortable in my opinion. The only complaint with the Baja is its sub standard stereo and the fact that no navigation system or satellite radio is offered.

Review:  I bought this Baja Sport as an economical alternative to my RAM 2500 Diesel for a round trip commute of 70 miles. Being only 5'9" and 180#, this vehicle seems harder to get in the driver's seat than any I have ever owned.  It also lacks the power of any previous vehicles. But, I did not buy for power and once you are in the driver's seat, this is one of the most enjoyable cars I have ever owned. It has a sports car ride and feel.  Interior finish sets the standard for its competitors.  Base vinyl/fabric seats are supportive, top quality, and everyone thinks it is leather. Door panels are equally impressive. Engine is very quiet. Transmission shifts smooth but downshifts at the slightest hill.

Review:  I sell Hondas, so you can imagine what kind of buyer I am. The Subaru is for my wife (yes I could not sell her a Honda). Anyways the car is great - she loves it, the only thing they need to improve is the pick up from 0 to 60 for the auto transmission, it's a little bit sluggish. Also a gas guzzler considering is a small car; we get 18.5 miles to gallon on city with light traffic. That is what I get in my V-6 Isuzu Rodeo 4x4, then again you have to consider that the Baja is an all wheel drive.  Overall I'll give a 9.5.

They handle beautifully, gets awesome gas mileage and has a wonderful sporty design. The comforts of a sedan with the utility of a truck. I had a 2000 Ford Focus before I got the Baja I have now, and when it started giving me problems, I wasted no time giving the dealership the keys and traded it for my very own, my first Subaru Baja. And I am happy I made the decision. This vehicle is certainly made for someone like me with the life style I have. Versatile and impressive. A well built machine for its day!

It handles ever bit as good as my Mustang and is a lot of fun to drive, costing me about the same in gas. The fold down back seat belongs to my Shar-Pei, and when he's not aboard it's perfect for all my shopping needs.  The locking bed is even better than any trunk I have ever had. It turns heads while I'm out and about and there is no lack of power, surprising many. It has perfect lines and the leather interior is the perfect touch for the near perfect vehicle which I call the "lady's pick up" as it's petite, sleek, fashionable and truly the best purchase I have ever made.

Title: Practical but slow
Review:  I am really getting attached to the Baja.  It's fun to drive because of its accurate steering and light weight.  There is a lot of aluminum on this vehicle (motor heads and block, tranny, differential cover, etc).  The bed looks really small, but I fit a full sized dirt bike in it (300cc) with gear bag and tool box.  No one believes that it will fit until they see it.  And that is WITHOUT folding down the pass through door to the cab.  The Baja is the slowest car I have ever driven, though.  I have an Isuzu pickup with 2.6L 4 cylinder motor (Baja 2.5L 4 cylinder) with 225k miles on it that is 3 times quicker.  And I always considered the Isuzu to be slow.  I am not exaggerating one bit about this.

I have never been one to let anyone influence my decisions. That's why it's parked in my driveway now. So far I am very pleased with it and I'm very glad I got the Turbo. It's very powerful and the functional hood scoop looks awesome!! The interior is simple but I sold my BMW 325 convertible to get one of these so it's a slight adjustment. I snowboard and wanted a vehicle that would do well in the snow. The reviews from other BAJA owners sold me. I can't wait to use it this coming winter. I wish these would come back into production.

Review:  At miles 6729, the transmission burnt.  Subaru will not install a new one.  Forced me to accept a re-built transmission.  The re-built transmission after 500 miles went bad also.  It started locking up in reverse gear and when driving around the corners.  The service department would not pay attention until I left the car at the dealership and threatened to sue under the Lemon Act.  They finally called in the Subaru technical rep who offered to replace it with a new transmission if I was going to keep the car.  I said, yes, got the new transmission and then traded it for a new 2005 Turbo model in April 2005.  The transmission on Baja is very poorly designed. It's very noisy to drive.

There are two drawbacks that I have  found 1)is that there is wind noise  once you get up over 65 MPH.

Review:  Only have 1200 miles on it, but I love  it.  Sold a Ford Ranger to get this  because it suits my needs better.   Turbo really gives it some power.   I'd recommend the turbo.  Features and  build of the car are solid.

Review:  I like them so much that i bought  another after the first one.They could  have left off some of the standard  items so they could sell them  cheaper.Still could use more power.I'm  planning on buying a 06 if it is built  on the new legacy/outback platform and  with the flat 6.Its fun to drive  especially in the rain.All in all its a  great car/truck.

Review:  This is our second Subaru this year. My  wife drives an 04 LLBean Outback. Funny  she like this almost as much. The ride  is car like and the seating is  comfortable ( front ) back seat is fine  for kids or adults on a short trip.  Mileage is improving with each fill up.  Get a lot of comments  like ..cool..awsome..etc. Get one you  wont be sorry

Title: Are you kidding me?
Review:  I am sold big time. I bought an all  silver, manual, turbo and boy can she  fly- and a real eye catcher.  This car  is an absolute blast to drive.  It is a sports car with the ability to  perform all the functions of a small  truck. Who knew!?  It is a four seater but lots of room  and very comfortable and the sound  system is excellent. I wanted  something reliable, fun and versatile  and this car is all of that. They make  a cover for the backend so essentially  you can store stuff like a trunk or  use it for hauling anything- the  versatility is insane. Suburu  reliability, amazingly fun, AWD! and  overall versatility of the vehicle -  all at an amazing price.

Title: Subaru Baja Turbo (all silver)
Review:  I have had the baja turbo for a little  over a week now.  I must say this  caruck (pronounced car'-uck) is a great  vehicle.  All reviews that I read  before buying this truck mentioned the  lack of space overall when mostly  compared to a pickup. I bought this  vehicle for the little home projects  that i want to do, my active lifestyle  (biking/hockey, etc) and this vehicle  suits my needs well.  You get the  vesatility of being able to go to home  depot or you get the great feeling of  leaving everyone in the dust off of the  start/w/turbo around the neighborhood.   ...steering wheel always hitting my leg  on the way in and to cumbersome to  raise and lower.

Title: The fun truck alternative
Review:  Replaced an old trusty Ford Ranger, and worried about the fact that the Baja is not a 'truck'.  I can still do almost everything I need to do, and many things I couldn't do before.  The Baja is just plain fun, especially with the 5-speed.  It really hugs the road and gives you a feel of control.  There's plenty of power in the 4-cyl with the 5-speed (drove the automatic and it felt a little sluggish), and the mileage beats most competitors.  The back seat isn't great, but I sit in the front!  Have not regretted this purchase.

Title: Other car a Vette &still lovin the Baja!
Review:  I have a Magnetic Red Corvette to play  with, but I gotta tell you the Baja  gets more looks and compliments. The car is so easy to drive, the engine  is smooth and powerful enough to take  on all but the fastest at stoplights.   The car can easily top 120 mph if you  like and the harder you drive it, the  better it performs.  All wheel drive  lets the the Subie and you laugh at  snow and ice.   Rain , Hah! Handles  like dry ground.     Gas mileage runs from 22 if driven like  your in a WRC race and up to 32 on high  way.      This is a car I would recommend to  anybody .  I flat out love it.

Title: Very Happy
Review:  Just got mine 2 weeks ago, 1000 miles  on it.  Yes, I rack up the miles.  I  love the fact that it is a bit  different and attracts attention.  But  most of all, I like the way it can  handle the roads and conditions here in  the NE.  An inch higher ground  clearance than my grand cherokee (150K  miles in 6 yrs), good pick-up and all  wheel drive.  This isn't a light little  thing either, not many lbs less than  the jeep, but significantly better  mileage and rides well over the rotten  roads here.  And the light grey bottom  amd darker gray top is an awesome  looking vehicle.  Will carry bikes or  hold all my camping gear.

Title: Baja Rocks!
Review:  This vehicle has just what I wanted,  and everything I needed. The ride,  space adn comfort of a car, and the  ability to throw whatever I need in the  back. I don't have to worry if I am  hauling something dirty or smelly, and  if it is something long, I can open the  back end. It may seem like a short bed  at first, but with the conversion of  teh back seat and the bed extender, it  is not bad at all. I have brought home  full sized panneling, lumber, lattice,  bags of concrete, and hauled many other  things like plants and muddy yard  tools. All I had to do was spray out  the back end!

The five speed was hard  to find but well worth the effort.  If  80% of the full size truck drivers  would admit to themselves that this is  all they really need for hauling and  off road operation---they would be a  lot happier on a daily basis.

Review:  "Not just weird, powerfully weird".   That was the best quote I've heard to  describe the Baja Turbo when it  launched last year.  I'm still waiting  on mine to arrive from the factory,  but I have driven each version of the  Baja made since it's intro in '03.   For those of us who need a small  truck, but not a buckboard-riding,  fuel sucking steel can, there's now a  wagon-based wannabeatruck that handles  real-life in the best of fashions.

Review:  I was originally looking to buy a Honda  Element for its cargo abilities, but I  was really drawn to the look of the  Baja. The Baja is extremely comfortable  and loaded with features. I drive the  vehicle to and from work most of the  time, but It holds my family  comfortably. For home use, the Baja  works great. I can go to the home  inprovement center and get everything I  need into the Baja's cargo area by  using the pass through area.  When I  need to carry larger loads, I tow a  8x10 trailer with little effort. I love  this little truck...and I get more than  20mpg everywhere I go..beat that.

Review:  Picked up the new 2004 Baja today. The turbo  option makes it surprisingly fun to drive, with  all the stability of my wife's Forrester. This is  not a luxury car, but more of a lad's car -- the  small pickup bed is going to be useful when  the snow melts and the weather improves.  Gets a lot of attention, unusual on the streets  of NYC. Silver color, looks quite sharp. For the  money, an attention-grabbing, outdoors  lifestyle-facilitating break from the mundane.

Review:  Recommend to those who a) haul large  object every now and then (it is not a  pickup truck, it's a car with a small  bed), b) don't race (if you do, go with  Forester or WRX), c) live in higher  altitude (above 8,000 ft) and still  need responsive engine, d) not too  concerned about gas mileage (about 22  mpg), e) like the looks (at least able  to tolerate), and f) if your bike  costed more than $1500 and always  nervous when it is on roofrack.  It's a  good alternative car for regular light  DIY Home Depot kind of folks.

Title: My '08 Reno
Review:  I just bought my '08 Reno a few days ago, and so far I'm very impressed with its performance and ride quality. MPG aren't too bad, but they could be a little better. For about 20-25 dollars you could expect to ride for a pretty good bit on a full tank. That's pretty good compared to a much bigger vehicle. My roommate has a minivan, and that take anywhere from thirty to forty dollars to fill up, and gas doesn't last half as long as it does in mine. I'm 24, and this is my very first vehicle, and so far I'm very happy, and well satisfied with my purchase.

Review:  I bought this '08 Reno with 2,400 miles on it. It's my ride from home to work and back. This is the first small car that I have ever owned. I traded in my '98 Lumina (168k miles)and $5400 cash and drove it off the lot. So many of the reviews have been less than complimentary, but as an owner, I think this is a great little car. 3 year/36k mile bumper to bumper, a 100k powertrain warranty, and 24 hour roadside assistance. I don't like the fact there aren't many dealerships around for service concerns, but I have only had one issue with the airbag light staying on all the time. Remember that you get what you pay for. I bought a 4-cylinder automatic. I don't expect to keep up with a Vette!

Title: fun small car
Review:  We bought this car with a sonata in mind but the price point was to much to pass up.  Its peppy and quick for such a small engine. Plan to put on wheels, Cruise, tint and keyless with an alarm.  Love it get lots of second looks in the parking lots.  Put on a coat of turtle wax ice and it looks great. Only problem was pass seat airbag light but was resolved in one visit. 12k out the door cash and we are really happy with it! Lots of room for a small car and with some things like new wheels and tires maybe springs it will handle even better. Also try a k&n airfilter it will bump up the hp and gas mileage! Had a Suzuki motorcycle and this lives up to the name!

Review:  I just purchased this vehicle but thought it odd there were no reviews from users on this vehicle (expert reviews are unkind). It truly is a bargain and drove every bit as well as a Ford Focus. Yes it is basic but for $240 a month for 60 months and 0 down how can you go wrong especially with the warranty this manufacturer offers. We all are facing some realities with gas prices escalating and while the given mileage specs aren't overly impressive most people are getting better than posted mileage. The interior is very nice a pleasent surprise This is the first time I have considered a compact car and I will be ok with this. I didn't feel silly in it and the Suzuki moniker adds intrigue

Title: 2006 Suzuki Reno
Review:  I got an '06 Reno in October of '15. It had 51k miles. I was surprised to find that this vehicle did not have cruise control, as many older vehicles (different make) do. The mpgs are not very good, even when using high octane fuel and keeping maintenance regular (correct air pressure in tires, clean air filter, oil changes ever 3k miles). I've already had to replace the head gasket in the engine. Come to find out there was an air bag/warranty issue for Renos, that effect/affect mine, according to the VIN. Not sure if it was the best choice, but I needed a car. It's still good, just think that an '06 vehicle, regardless of who it's from, should have cruise control. According to good 'ol Google, '06 Renos get 20 city and 28 highway.

Title: Worst mistake of my life
Review:  Bought this car and an emergency car in January 2014 after I totaled my last car. Car was great for 5 months when the check engine came on. Turns out it was the throttle body,  which was no longer made. Dealt with it for another year and few months before everything started going wrong. Lower control arms needed replaced, quickly followed by having to replace the entire shifter assembly.  Both front and rear struts need replaced, including the mounting and stabilizers. Rack and pinions are starting to leak, has to replace a oil gasket, and now the throttle position sensor is shot. Only a dealer can calibrate a new one, and you have to replace the whole throttle body, not just the sensor. Only 69100 miles on this car, it shouldn't have all these issues!

Title: 2006 Suzuki Reno
Review:  I purchased my car in 2011 at 48,000 miles, and the biggest problem is that it isn't good on gas. Also, I was told by a mechanic at a a Goodyear Service Center two days ago that I might need struts, rack and pinion work and rods!!! Even though the car was given a clean bill of health just six months ago, and only has 52,000 miles on it. Today, I went to the Suzuki authorized service center and they said I don't need anything but an alignment and new wipers. They thought the struts where getting dry, but not a problem. Seems to me Goodyear wanted to make a little money.To be safe, I am taking it to a third shop just in case. Luckily, I purchased an extended warranty.

The price of the standard tires was higher than I expected.  Every tire place I went to said they were not a size they stocked, so that was surprising.  But overall, I really like the car so far.

Now they tell me its normal. They dont tell you about recalls until you call for other issues or hear about it from someone else. I had the transmission replaced & that took over two weeks & 2 different transmissions. The dealer never called me i had to call them to check on the car. My brother also has one and he has had his in the shop more than he gets to drive it.

I work downtown and I needed a small, reliable commuter that was reasonable on gas but still fun to drive. This car delivers. I bought it with just over 40k miles on it and so far have had no problems. The flat torque curve of this engine allows it to pull even in 5 gear which is unusual for a car this size. I went with an 8 for reliability due to my short ownership. The car handles like a go-cart and winds up nicely. I paid 6k used (it's a 2006)- (a deal a customer could have gotten) Value-wise-- 10!

Review:  This has to be one of the best deals I've ever gotten on a used car. Bought  it less than a year old, with 8500 miles.  The cost was already 2/3 of a new one.  All the complaints I've read about have never happened to me.  There were 3 recalls that the Suzuki dealer performed - one for a wiring harness, one for a seatbelt thing, and the other for the running lights.  I took this car on a road trip across Texas and back and was very good on gas.  For $200 I put a Pioneer radio and it made all the difference in the world.

Then the car had the head light not working problem. Then my front drivers seat came disconnected from the base. The tires wore out in under a year. The check engine light keeps coming on for no reason. The mileage is not good for that small a car. I was just told that I already need to replace the rear breaks. The service from Suzuki is bad. They knew about the starter problem when I called and told me they were working on a fix, I would just have to wait. I only had the car for less then a month. It is a bad, bad, bad car.

I had the problem with it not starting for the 1st 6mo I had it-the dealership could never fix it but it stopped happening. Then I had an airflow problem (scary)- The tires wore out (low profile)at 24000. And, I've had non-stop issues with the airbag sensor, that they just can't seem to fix. I was just told that it would probably need a new Serp. belt soon. But, the car is fun to drive, sporty, decent on mpg. MPG could be better for a car this size, but It's better than an SUV! If you know how to drive the automatic as a manual (as you can in this car) really gets up and goes.

Title: Happy so far.
Review:  We bought a 06 Reno a few years ago and so far has been a reliable car, overall I like the car. I'm around 6-2ish and I fit comfortably into the vehicle. No knees into the glove box, no hair touching the upholstry on the roor. Has gotten a bit cramped with the addition of a car seat, had to move pass seat forward.  Have not had any major mechanical problems to this point. Have not experienced the bad starting as some others have. Did eat through the factory serp belt though by 36,000. Have flushed the engine cooling system and serviced the auto trans, no problems with the fluid exchanges either. MPG is nothing to totally rave about, but full it once a week, not terrible.

Vehicle: 2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M)
Title: Reno's great mileage and Comfort
Review:  I kept looking at that Reno sitting up a pedistal outside the dearlership for about a month. The looks and the price was very attractive. I decided to stop and see how the performance was and to tell you the truth. I was actually surprised by what that 2.0 liter will do. If your not afraid to put your foot in it, it will get you down the road quick. Anyway, I am 6'2" and I fit in that car like Jim Carey says, "like a glovvvveee". It handles real well, and the mileage...OMG...I go to Illinois from Alabama and I don't stop for gas until I get to Champagne which is like 450 miles from Huntsville. I love this car. Great car!

Vehicle: 2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M)
Title: Awesome toy
Review:  I bought the car and to be honest with you, stock, the car isn't much, but after putting some 17" rims, limo tint, a sound system, underglow light, a custom grille and much more, that car has turned into a one of a kind here where I live. The manual has a lot more power than it look like. Adding NOS, turbo chargers, intake, exhaust will really make this car get up and race with the best.  If anyone wants a car at an affordable price that you want to fix up and make unique, then I recommend this car

Vehicle: 2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A)
Title: Nothing but Trouble from the Start
Review:  I bought this Reno new and since day "two" it's been nothing but trouble.  The second day it left us stranded and wouldn't start.  The dealer towed it back said it was fixed.  We got six miles from dealer it stopped again.  The dealer had it for six days returned it said it was all fixed.  Then three days later the same thing happened, it wouldn't start.  The dealer had it again and replaced more parts.  It runs now, but gets poor fuel economy - only 20 mpg in the city.  Yesterday my wife started it, turned on heater, and it sounded like a bomb went off.  There was some acorns packed in heater.  We called dealer and he said it was not their problem.  I took it apart and there is NO screen over the heater motor under hood and it was full of nuts.  The tranny still doesn't shift right.  I will never buy another Suzuki.  It is the worst car I have ever bought!

Title: Under the Shadow
Review:  While overshadowed by bigger names such as the Toyota Scion series, Mazda, Honda, and others, the Suzuki Reno stands as the under dog. With "European Styling", a comfortable and spacious interior,a fun driving experience, and an affordable price tag, the Suzuki Reno is perfect for the average college student or young person. The Reno is an all-around fun car, and you wont be embarrassed to show it off to your friends. I would suggest the Suzuki Reno to anyone in the market for a very nice and practical new car.

Vehicle: 2018 Tesla Model X SUV 100D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD)
Title: Crazy good, despite many small flaws
Review:  A lot of the existing reviews online, including the 2017 and 2018 Edmunds reviews here are a little out of date due to the continuous improvements that Tesla makes to their production process as well as the after production updates via Tesla's amazing over the air update system. For example, the latest navigation and autopilot updates as of July 2018 make this car vastly superior to anything else on the road in these areas.  Also, based on my model that was built in late 2017, the fit and finish seems to be slowly improving as well. PROS: - As noted by many others, the handling and acceleration are better than any other SUV on the market. Driving a Model X feels like magic.- Utility is excellent due to the huge amount of interior space, thanks in large part to the lack of engine and gas tank. Yes, there are no roof racks, but most of what you would put up on the roof can be stowed inside the cabin or in the fronk with much more convenience. For towing, the auto leveling air suspension, included tow hitch, and the vast torque allow the model X to easily tow just about anything. (Quantis just towed a 787 Dreamliner with a Tesla Model X for publicity). Technically though, the X is legally rated to 5,000 lbs and towing will reduce your range by roughly 20% depending on various factors, so you have to take that into account. - Range provided by the 100D is fantastic at around 300 miles. That along with the Tesla charging network, road trips have been a dream. - My favorite feature is Autopilot, which has gotten so good that I no longer want to drive without it. It feels a lot safer and easier to have both yourself and the car reacting to situations in real time. For example, if you look down for a moment and someone slams on the breaks in front of you, Autopilot will automatically slow down. I've also noticed that in dark, rainy conditions, Autopilot seems to be better at seeing the road ahead than I can due to the array of sensors, which was really surprising. - The built-in Navigation is the best I've seen in any car by a wide margin. It's just like using Google maps on your phone, but built-in and easily visible on the huge display. The voice recognition works amazingly well too, meaning you can just say; "navigate to home depot", and it just works. CONS: - The falcon wing doors are great to show off to your friends, but they are not practical. In a normal garage for instance, they can't open fully so you have to crawl under them to get into the car. - Tesla's push button door handles require a lot of force to activate and are irritating. I'd personally prefer the 3% hit to range to get back regular door handles. - My Model X was built in late 2017 and the build quality is clearly improving, but I did have a couple of small fit and finish issues that required me to drop my X off for repair immediately after pickup. - The X is not an off-road capable SUV. - The worst thing about the model X in my opinion are the seats. The Model X seats don't even compare to a top trim 2018 Honda CRV. My wife has a 2017 Lexus RX 450h which is half the cost, and the Lexus seats and about twice as comfortable and are much more luxurious than the throw away vinyl seats you get in the Tesla Model X. Since nicer seats can be be procured from the same vendors that make seats for the other car brands, it seems criminal to me that the Tesla Model X is so badly lacking in this area.  If you get a Tesla, you will have the best car on the planet, except you will probably have the worst seats of any car in the $40K+ price range. The included "vegan leather" seats, seem to be there to placate PETA and other environmentalists that don't like leather being used in cars. I get that, but at the very least, vinyl should be standard and real, perforated leather, similar to what you find in every other nice car, should be an option. Overall, the Tesla Model X is such a vast improvement over every other SUV on the market, it's definitely worth putting up with the small flaws to own one.

Title: Double trouble
Review:  We own both the XC90 and S60and have been frustrated with both vehicles.Both have seen more than their fair share of the service department and the lack of concern from Volvo has been discouraging.In two years of the S60, we have had to replace the ignition switches twice. The emergency cable never really engaged properly so it had to be adjusted as well as the sunroof at a cost. A faulty ABS contact reeel and front axle shaft had to be replaced due to recalls. The headlight washer fell off and had to be replaced twice. As if we didnt feel nickeled and dimed already, we now have to replace the Fire Trap Housing not covered on the warranty. We are very disappointed.

Review:  This is my first Volvo, had an Acura and Maxima before this.  I've had this car for approx 18 mos, bought it used with 9500 miles and love it.  It is built very tight and feels heavier than it is.  The turbo gives it a lot of power when merging or trying to pass. Highway driving is excellent, it definitely loves to cruise. The back seat is tight, I have  an 8 year old and 10 year old and I have to move the passenger seat and my seat forward for them.  Quality so far is fine,front headlight washers needed new motors and the computer has had to be updated once because the immobilizer would occasionally get triggered preventing it from starting.  Problem fixed but it still does it sometimes.

Title: Relability Stinks
Review:  I liked this car a lot when I first bought it. Now I regret my purchase. It's too small for a normal sized person and forget about fitting anyone in the back seat. It's too small for even a child. The trunk space is not practical. It's not a true sport sedan and the gas mileage is poor considering its size and that it has only 5 cylinders. Furthermore, the relability is suspect. It has been to the dealership 4 times in 4 months for two intermitent problems (antilock brakes and the radio). No resolution for the second problem yet. The dealer has not been able to fix the problem without keeping the car for a week at a time. Bottom line: Don't make my mistake, buy Japanese.

Wife and myself sat in the S40 just looked at each other and  knew that we didnt want another small car, took the s60 out for a test drive and we were hooked. It was love at first sight. Within 3 hours we drove the machine home. This is not a car, its a driving machine. Of course that coming out of a Nissan that dragged you down the road while the S60 gives you a ride on the road. It was late and the s60 tank was on empty, stopped for gas 3.65 a gal it took $44 to fill the tank. Now I remember why I bought the Nissan. Driving it home we were all smiles.

The drive is powerful, and the acceleration with the geartronic transmission makes the car very fun to drive.  The leather, stereo, etc., is just enough luxury for me.

I have had to buy two complete new sets of tires during that period.  Last time was because I had a blowout on the highway.  The alignment has to be redesigned so it isn't so sensitive to any bumps.

Review:  I looked at BMW, Audi, and MB, and by far the best power/quality/features combination for the money was the S60R.  The car performs at its best with quality 93 octane gasoline.  By quality I mean from Shell, Exxon, Chevron, etc., not Texaco, Citgo, etc.  Any low quality gas or under 93 octane and you will have a non turbo S60 2.5L.  Also, it is important to have the foot on the entire accelerator pedal for best results. City driving and hard acceleration now and then, yields 21-22 mpg.  Almost nobody knows what is under the hood, so it is fun to see other drivers trying to race you from light to light and being left behind every single time.

The car is unique to look at , you hardly see R on the road and anyone who's knows performance sedans is aware of what it can do head to head. My neighbor ended up ordering the new 300 Lexus with the 307hp motor. My car came in a week earlier then his, the look on his face said "I wish I had considered the R".

The Volvo trunk, bumper was smashed back to the rear wheels and some damage was found in the bracing, not the frame.

I'd never heard of the S60R, but when I learned about it, I found it fit my lifestyle to a "T".  It's a sports car when I want it to be, and a people hauler when it needs to be.  The trunk is surprisingly large.  Passengers can't stop commenting on how supple the leather is.  I can't wait to go to work in the morning because I get to drive my car there.

You really see the difference in handling on the different road types. The performance of the car is great. My transmission is auto, the manual trans take away one full sec from 0-60. The quality of the interior is excellent; you will see all the gizmos that the car has. The space of the back seats is very small. But if you have kids just buy a mini van. If you are going to buy a Volvo s60r I recommend you to buy the sport body option.

I think it's super quick with the automatic; feels a lot quicker than an '05 demo I drove last year and faster than the spec. Great seats, and the adjustable suspension really works.  So far, it's been problem free for 5 months.  Good price: $37K for automatic with some packsges(amounted to $300 over invoice AND less $2250 incentive.)  We may have gotten the last one for while, since it doesn't look like Volvo will make an '07 R and there's talk of dropping the S60 altogether.  Looked at TL (too common and FWD), G35 (didn't feel as confident to drive or as quick), Mustang GT, (too banal), Maxima (FWD, etc, etc.), Audi...

Title: Unsuspecting S60R
Review:  We had never even considered looking at a Volvo and were looking primarily at Audi's when a teenager mentioned that we should try the s60r.  Best advice!  We loved it and bought it.  More luxury than we expected, handles amazingly and so damn fast!  It was a surprise to us and we are so happy with it - yes we agree about the turning radius though, a sacrifice we are willing to make.

Title: Volvo's Secret
Review:  Volvo's secret is the buy of the year. Fast, safe, stylish and 10 to 15K less expensive than an Audi S4 or BMW 540i.Great interior(except for the roof liner). The Brembo brakes inspire confidence to drive faster than you should. The shifter is quick and precise but the clutch is a little quirky. Steering could be a little more precise, but this is subjective as my last car was an Audi TT. The suspension in either sport or advanced provides a nice tight ride and in comfort(which I use when my wife is with me) is still fun and very smooth. Its a ggod thing that few people know about the R or I may have had a much longer wait to get this car (2 weeks, it was on the boat).

Title: Nice additio0n to the Volvo line-up
Review:  Was looking for a car for my wife that had safety, comfort, looks and speed.  Also didn't want a common choice (Audi, Infinity, Acura, BMW) however we tested them all.  The S60R was a real suprise in the interior department - VERY plush and comfortable.  Back seat is for children only, though.  Trunk is large, and doors are easy to enter/exit.  Safety features are everywhere. Exterior is real sharp with sleek lines and sporty look.  The fun part of this car is it's speed and handling.  High velocity going around a big bend in "advanced" is thrilling - tight with great control.  Not the sweetest of sounds when under full throttle, but does grow on you.  Brakes are teriffic.

Title: It's G-RRRRRR-EAT
Review:  Excellent value for the price.  I would have liked to purchase more of the extras, but wanted an S60R now!  After the test drive I lost sleep waiting to purchase.  I would have purchased two, but opted to purchase a Dodge Charger SRT-8 as our "bigger" car.  The sixth gear is an asset.  The fuel economy is nice.  We traded in our 2004 S60 and feel that the R version is heads and shoulders above the competition and other S60 models.  The gauges are gorgeous!!  The overall interior room could be a bit bigger (this is my one and only negative point).  But the size is just right for a small family.  As you step into the car, an ambiance of complete safety surrounds you.

Title: No luck for me
Review:  I was trying to save a bit of money so after doing much research, I turned in my BMW for a Volvo.  In 4 months time, I have had 3 tire blow outs, replaced a rim, had a faulty passanger airbag that does not work(the sensor had to be ordered since the car is so new) and my ipod adaptor broke.  I was tired of spending more time at Volvo service than driving the car. I was fed up with all this happening with a 4 month old car. Today I happily traded the Volvo in for a BMW which I know will be reliable and I am extrememly happy with my decision and my new car.

Review:  After a long research Volvo S60R was never in my radar.  However, it is the most well balanced car.  It is like a japanese katana blade, it has a fierce power in the torque, horse power and the AWD really really HUGS the road.  S60R is not only a fast car but the safest on the road. Volvo has finally stepped up in its foundation in safe now they are moving into speed.  i love it when you turn on the car the turbo sound really speaks to me like its telling me to drive me FAST!  i top this car at 138 i would had gone faster but didnt bother too.

Title: Sleeper
Review:  After a long research period and a slew of test drives (shucks) I finally selected the S60 R.  My selection criteria were: 300 hp, AWD, and convertible; and I looked at GS300 AWD, G35 AWD, Z Roadster, M3, 330 xi, C55 AMG, SLK 350, WRX STi, and S4.  None of the cars match all three criteria, but the S60 R did the best at the most affordable price.  I also like the fact you don't see them everywhere like you would with a BMW.  And aside from a few small "R"s there is nothing that readily identifies this Volvo as the hot rod version.  The S60 R is the atheltic WRX STi that has grown up and wearing a suit and tie.

Title: Safe and Fast
Review:  After one initial problem with a connector for the 4C system, which was repaired very efficiently, this car is absolutely a joy to own.  I put on a lot of highway mileage and am constantly surprised at the reserve of power available.  Ramps and corners can be taken safely at speeds that would couse wrecks in other cars.  The Canadian model comes with every option (except snow tires) that anyone needs or could want.  I considered Audi, BMW and G35, but these cars just don't have the same power/safety per dollar value (the Audi and G35 are also very unattractive vehicles, in my opinion).  BMW (M3)is too small, lacks 4WD, expensive to repair and more suitable for people who want snob appeal.

Volvo included all the features I needed/wanted in a beautiful pkg that's a blast to drive.  Cool looking and very comfortable interior.  Only warning is that the sport pkg skirts are very low and the steering in tight places - parking lots is not very tight.  Once you get used to it, it's fine.

The wheel bearings went out, rear tail lights went out, it burned 1 quart of oil every 1000 miles, the chassis started to loosen up after 6000 miles.

Title: Best Car I've Owned
Review:  Performance is astounding! 5.4 seconds to 60 with the stick, or 6.0 with the automatic. Great handling and tire grip. . 4-piston Brembo front and rear brakes stop on a dime. The BEST feature is the adjustable suspension, which has 3 positions: Comfort, Sport, amd Agreesive, which increase suspension stiffness and enhance handling further! And the agressive mode puts the transmission in the Sport mode, which inceases acceleration! Comfort, considering the 18" wheels, is very good, but don't expect the ride to be as soft as a Buick. Also, rear seat is a bit cramped. Just one more inch of leg room would help! Great reliabilty, great durability/build quality, and excellent value! Phenomenal car!

Title: Perception is not always reality
Review:  My Buick Envision is an excellent machine. It's major problem is perception. It is supposed to be a luxury SUV, but when most people think of a luxury SUV, they think Cadillac, Lincoln, Acura, BMW,Mercedes or other brands. When I was shopping for an SUV, I went to a GMC dealer looking for a Terrain. The dealer also sold Buicks. I Had never even heard of the Envision. The saleswoman showed a better equipped Envision for much less than the Terrain.  Test driving both vehicles,  I liked the Envision better. Not that the Terrain was bad, but the Buick was a better value, and here lies the problem. Someone looking for a Chevy, Ford or a Japanese or Korean SUV would not even think of a Buick, just like someone wanting a "luxury " SUV  would probably overlook a Buick. It seems that Buick SUVS are neither fish nor fowl. So if you are considering an SUV,  give Buick a look and see if there is more value there for you

Title: The Essence!
Review:  I really like this little SUV / Crossover.  The dealer has let us use this vehicle while our car has been in the shop for the last 1.5 weeks and I'll be a bit sad to let it go.  I looks great on the outside and inside and I can fit my 6ft 3in 215lbs 50 year old frame into the very comfortable, heated, leather, drivers seat just fine with plenty of head room.  It's easy to get out of too and the roomy rear seat area is similar.  Our vehicle comes with heated rear seats and rear HVAC controls.  The interior is nicely equipped with faux wood highlights and panels, the dash knobs and buttons and the instrument cluster gauges seem to be well placed and the infotainment system works great other than sometimes it automatically connects to my iphone and other times it asks to connect.  This might be because the SUV is in demonstration mode... at least this is what the SUV tells me whenever I start it up.  I also like the auto open/close rear hatch.  I can adjust it so it only opens 3/4 or fully.  With it set at 3/4 I can open it in my garage.  It drives very nicely and comfortably and I have good visibility other than the front window posts are a bit thick which looks nice but sometimes can hide an approaching car.  The vehicle is punchy and takes off well when I hit the throttle hard but it obviously doesn't have the 300hp my sedan has.  It brakes well and holds a line well while accelerating, cruising and braking.  It also has the auto start feature.  It's kind of weird coming to a stop at a stop light and feeling the engine stop.  It starts right up quickly so really no complaints there, I just wish it would wait a bit longer before shutting down.  Overall, I really really like this SUV.  It's comfortable, handles nicely, has plenty of comfort features, quiet and seems well made.  That being said, there's only 5k miles on it and I've only had it for a week and a half.

Title: Buick Envision Sporty Midsize SUV!
Review:  Fell in love with this vehicle after renting the standard model for a week on a business trip. Drive almost any other midsize suv after driving the Envision, and you will really notice the difference. One of the only vehicles, where the engine is not directly mounted to the frame. Very little vibration, quiet, smooth ride for a midsize suv. Handling and braking is great! We leased the Premium 1 with the Turbo. Very lineal torque curve, not a lot of down shifting on the highway. Smooth 6 speed, and no engine noise except when you accelerate. Interior fit and finish is excellent. Highway mileage was 26 mpg on our first highway trip. If the start stop feature bothers you, just shift it into "L" and click it to 6. It will cancel out the stop start feature. Very happy with this selection.

Title: Great Car with one BIG bug
Review:  UPDATE. Now I'm getting a bad smell from the AC ever time I start the car. Went to the dealer and they said to spray AC fresh in to intake duct. What a crop or crap. We only have 8000 miles on the car....This is my last buick....... I would give the car 5 stars on everything if it didn't come with one GREAT BIG BUG. Every time you come to a stop the engine stalls and dies. Now there is nothing wrong with the engine because someone at buick though it would be a good idea to shut the engine down every time you come to a stop. They need to kick that guy to the curb. If you test drive the car when it's very hot the AC will keep the engine running when you stop but when the heat lets up the car thinks you only need AC when your moving the darn thing stops running every time you stop. On some GM cars they put a button in so you could deactivate this annoying feature. I realy do think the owner should have the option to take the car in and have the dealer reprogram the computer to deactivate the ENGINE AUTO STOP. If I had knew about this when I test drove the car I would have never bought it. It reminds of my younger days when I had to drive junkers and every time I pulled up to the red light the car would die. Hated it then and realy hate in even more now with a $46000.00 car. BEWARE

Review:  Electronics, nav, etc controlled mostly with touch screen. I'd like to have more functions controlled on the steering wheel.  Rear cargo area will not fit golf clubs transversely.  Integration with phones, IOS and Android is excellent, but everything must be controlled via the touchscreen, and this requires taking ones eyes off the road, not too  much different than texting.  The control pad on the right side of the steering wheel controls information screens on the center of the dash, such as gas mileage, next oil change etc.  All of these could be controlled by another means, and the control pad on the steering wheel used to control functions on the touchscreen.  I believe this is a serious flaw in design, and is as dangerous as texting while driving.

Title: Last Buick EVER!
Review:  Traded an 2015 Encore for the slightly larger 2017 Envision. Loved the Encore's quietness, shifting and general driveability. The Envision has more engine noise, transmission shifts like a 60's powerglide and the autostop is a horrible addition to any car. The little vibration it makes when it starts up is really annoying. Making a left turn from the middle of a busy intersection is very scary when the engine cuts off and you have to hope it restarts. I doubt this car will make it two years in my garage and I seriously doubt that another Buick will ever be in my garage and by the way, I've had at least 3 or 4 previously. Still HATE the auto stop but found that if you shift to L and then use the manual shift button to shift up to 6 then the transmission upshifts and downshifts like any other transmission and the auto stop feature does not work. Worst Buick ever for road noise.

Review:  I traded-in my Lexus NX ... loved the performance ... but CarPlay was not available with aftermarket radios or in a new Lexus (but hear it is ‘coming soon’ to at least some models).  Having CarPlay in the Buick has already (in just the first 2 days) saved on highway toll charges and got me quickly to my destination in a new development 30 miles from home.  I would have eventually gotten to the same location but it would have been a LOT harder to find with the built-in navigation.  The Buick handling, ride and performance -- comparable to the NX ... has been terrific.  Drove it from VA to FL for a 45 day vacation.  Performance was excellent and gas mileage on the long stretches was amazing.  Coming back I was getting 540 mile range after a fill-up vas normally 410-430 city driving.

Since then, it's been in and out of the dealership for everything from a noise that is blatantly obvious that comes from somewhere near the gas tank that comes in at certain speeds and has been in for 3 times to try to cure, to a failed operating system. By the way--apparently it takes 7-10 days to get a part for the automobile. If I had to do over, I wouldn't buy that car. For the same money, go buy a Mercedes.

Title: Sold vehicle after 3 months - Issues
Review:  As another reviewer noted, the vehicle has a shake when accelerating from a stop.   It is usually not experienced in a slow/mild acceleration.  But, when turning or straight acceleration on an incline, there is a noticeable shake/shudder while in 1st gear.  The harder the acceleration,  the more severe the shake.  I've even paid to have my local tire store check the tires and balance.  This should not be in a vehicle of this class and price point.  I hope Buick identifies the source of this issue and gets a fix in dealers hands, and proactively notifies owners, before more reviews make note of this apparent defect.  Once you are moving, the Envision's ride and handling is exceptional, quiet and smooth.  For such a soft ride, it is very responsive and does not have cornering body roll.   I love the interior design and materials,  but would prefer slightly softer seats.  The safety features are nice.  I personally do not like the Lane Departure feature and have turned it off.  You find yourself constantly fighting the steering wheel.  The stop/start feature is ok.  But, it should have a couple second delay.  When making parking maneuvers, the engine cuts off on you ... this should have been thought out a bit better.  Overall, it is a nice vehicle at a reasonable price point, but has a few quirks that you should think about.UPDATE:  I sold the vehicle after 3 months.  I just couldn't stand the engine stop/start feature.  Also, the shaking that I, and others, have mentioned was unresolved by two dealers.  They both said that it is common for the Envision.

Title: Best Bang for Your Buck$$$
Review:  I have owned other mid-size and smaller SUV's and this one is as good or better than those that cost almost twice as much. I made riding in my Rav4 or CRV seem like I was in a tractor. Typical smooth Buick ride with all the techno upgrades. We have 3 smaller grandchildren and we all love it!!!

The back up monitor is the worst I have every seen, can not see anything at all at dusk or dawn, exhaust has a bad rattle and the heater motor sounds terrible.

Title: How much more do you need?
Review:  I am 75 years old. I have had 6 Buick’s, as well as many other brands over the years.All of the Buick’s have had all the options available at the time. This care outshines the others cars by a lot. Have owned the car now 20 months. Have not had a single problem at all. I have the premium 1 model no moonroof. Sticker price 43k. This car was cheaper than the Audi with almost all of the same options. The stop start is not a bother at all. The engine restart in less than a second after your foot off the brake. Merging power and highway passing acceleration is more than enough. Cruising at 75 mph is no strain. The best thing of all is how quiet the interior is. There are active white noise speaker on the base of the exit handles on the ceiling. They nullify almost all of the road noise at ear level. Seats are comfortable. All controls easy to reach. Front and side vision better than the Audi. Gas mileage is dead on to what Buick says.

Title: In for repairs for 45 days no help from GM
Review:  2016 Premium 1 has been at the dealership for repairs because of all safety systems faults (Air Bags, ABS, AWD, Power Steering, Stability Control, you name it) for 45 days now. GM Senior Advisor was assigned to my case bu would not answer my phone call or return them. Finally after several attempts to get some answers on getting this problem resolved I had an attorney write a letter to GM stating my states lemon law. Within 2 days my "Senior Advisor" found my email address and sent me an update on my case. Only stating that because I involved legal console that she could no longer assist me. Well she haven't been assisting with anything to that point so I'm not sure what changed. Now at 45 days out of service I continue to wait with no other feedback on a resolution.

Title: Smooth, efficient, with great handling
Review:  Update: My best mileage is 32 mpg at 65 mph with just me or 30 mpg loaded at thr same speed. 12,000 miles and the oil life is saying it is time for an oil change.  I love the freebies when it is 20°F out otherwise I be in thr unheated garage doing it myself.  I love the heated steering wheel as it get very warm.  The heated seats are appreciated by all four of us and thr heated mirrors work great too.  The AWD is perfect on the white stuff and seldom slips unless you want to punch the throttle. With 3,000  miles on our 2016 Envision Prem ll, we picked up used in the mid-$30's,  the moonroof and Driver Confidence Package are quite the deal compared to the more expensive German car companies.  My in-laws are quite smitten with the Envision overall and are considering one for their next purchase. I searched new/used 2.0l turbo for months as it has AWD and torque vectoring included. The 2017 Prem ll discounted was capped my lower models starting at $35K.  So our 2016 Prem ll GM executive driven with 3,000 miles in the next state over was lightly driven with no excessive tire wear, so I know it was not used for closed course driving events.  New 2016 with no options were popping up for $10K off or $33K but I did not want white or silver, so it pays to shop with discounts like that and spend a few hundred to have it shipped.  Currently getting 25 mpg on my half city/highway commute now that it is warming up.  The ride is super quiet and smooth I'm surprised how well it isolates from the road, it is refreshing after a day at work.

Review:  The front seats are remarkably uncomfortable. I can't imagine how an engineer figured out how to combine a church pew, high school bleecher, and a cheap 1970's lawn chair, but they succeeded. And I don't think the Buick designers ever encountered a switch or knob they didn't like, or wanted to use. The adjectives I would use to describe this car are: squirley, buisy, jittery,. I would opt for a nicely equiped, low mileage pre-owned AWD wagon, maybe a Volvo.

Title: Smooth ride, solid inside and out.
Review:  Update:  winter driving was a breeze with Twin  Clutch Awd on the stock tires.  The remote start from remote or OnStar app worked like a charm as the car is running when I walk up to it and can take off as soon as I enter.  The heated steering is our favorite feature and very hot.  Seats could be hotter but I only have a 8 mile drive to work.  Next up springtime driving to see some new record fuel economy numbers now that she is well broken in at 15,000 miles.Update: We are seeing 32 mpg @65 mph for hours on end.  Fully loaded the fuel economy drops to a respectable 30 mpg at the same speed.  Very impressive in this segment to see a 2.0T 4,000 lbs SUV with AWD get into the 30's.  My wife finally got to drive it out of town for business.  She doesn't like all the electrical nanny's but boy does it move on the highway.  Next up...wintertime driving. 9,000 miles now.Coming from a 2013 and 2014 Cadillac, both of which I still have, the Buick is refreshingly solid and comforting in both riding and driving.  We got a used 2016 Premium ll with roof and Driver Confidence.  Plenty of head room with the sun roof in all seating positions.  The Adaptive Cruise Control along with the self parking feature and lane assist are really neat features. The parking is neat show off feature that this car is very easy to park and see out of.  The lane assist will have you bouncing off each side of the lane for miles, which is a little scary at first.  The ride quality is refined compared to the stiffer, performance oriented Cadillac.   The handling does not take a back seat to the softer suspension that this tracks and takes input better than a rental 2017 Escape we drove 6 hours to pick up the Buick.

Title: An incomparable  luxury roadster
Review:  It's hard for me not to take second, third and fourth looks at my Infra-red 2007 XLR when it's parked. It looks like no other car-- unique from every angle-- a true work of automotive art that was hand built by G.M in their Corvette plant.  This is a sports car that will provide you with the finest,  most quiet, and most comfortable ride on virtually every road surface.  Driven sensibly, it will give you 25 miles to a gallon of gas.  For its time, the electronics were top of the line, but alas, it does not have blue tooth or an audio input into the sound system.  My wife and I selected to purchase "On _Star and activate the XM.  Aside from having a failsafe navigation system in the car with the cd map, the On Star provides you with audio directions through the Boise sound system  Additionally, each month you receive a mechanical report on the state of your car's many systems--- so you are confident about the car's operation.  The used car values for XLR are relatively steep,  but if you find one with low mileage that has had the benefit of a mature driver you'll be very please with the purchase.  It's the most fun you'll ever have in a car!

Review:  I tend to drive a car hard.  This beauty can take it. The curves and laps disappear while admiring glances stand back and peer. I can't take this car out without some one having something glowing to say about it.  It is a real looker.  From LA to San Francisco the ride was smooth and easy. I arrived fresh as a daisy and ready to party at the wedding I was attending.  Waking up to a flat tire  bummed me out, until I realized it could drive 300 miles on the run-flats it came with. So I went to breakfast as planned . Later with the assistance of On-star  I casually sought out  a tire repair store. Goodyear did the trick, and I was on my way.  The joys and goodies are too many to name.

Review:  I've driven a lot of different high end and sports cars, so when it came time to step it up to the 6-figure market, I had a lot to choose from. I chose the xlr-v for the styling, the acceleration, the hard top, the fact that all the options are included at base price (unlike the M6 or the SL550) and that it had a much more attractive and distinctive exterior body style than most cars in its class. I have driven this car almost every day (despite having 4 other cars at home to choose from), and I have yet to be disappointed.  This car is fast, comfy, technologically sophisticated, and it's a head-turner.

Title: Five years old and not a darned thing wrong yet!
Review:  Bought it used with 18,000 miles (lease return) three years ago. It now has 55,000+ miles on it.  So far this car has been absolutely perfect. The interior is still flawless. I had a softer taller and fatter high-end set of Michelin tires installed on the stock 17" rims and it glides so much smoother now than the original tires on it.  It doesn't get the highest fuel economy but then again it's not a Prius... this baby flies.  My guess is that the mileage is affected from me getting into the 272 HP turbo charged power plant.  Everyone who has driven this car says it drives like a sports car (not a Cadillac Sedan).  What more can you ask for... Cadillac Styling with ample performance and decent fuel mileage.  I'll probably keep it for a long time.  By the way, the CUE entertainment system will drive you batty at first. But eventually you'll get it figured out. I suggest you use the controls in the steering wheel as much as possible. Otherwise you'll find that you can get distracted fiddling with them.  My only complaint is the CUE system and the cramped back seat.

Vehicle: 2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A)
Title: You don't know what you are missing.
Review:  Before owning the ATS, I had two BMWs (both bought new,) a 2002 325i and a 2005 Z4.  When I traded in my 325i in 2013, didn't want another BMW, but I did want a rear wheel drive car that would give me a ride similar to the BMW.  Well, truth be told,  when compared to my 325 and the newer BMW 3-series cars, I found the ATS' steering, road holding capabilities, road comfort, dashboard panel and interior to be superior.  This car took turns without leaning, and considering its great suspension, it rarely felt "jittery" on regular roads.  It's 2L turbo was quick enough for me.  However, I must say that although the BMW's turbo engine and transmission were smoother, the ATS was still a more enjoyable car to toss around.  The car's touch screen infotainment system got a lot of bad raps, but I didn't have any problems with it.  Nonetheless, it does appear that over the years, the negative reviews of the infotainment system seems to have had precedent over the car's excellent road performance and has undeservedly decreased the car's resale value.  Good new for those who are looking at the ATS (but bad for me when I will sell the car in another 2-3 years).  My overall recommendation to anyone interested in this car is not to waste any time and just buy it.  You'll have a great car at a very great price.

Title: Not as great as you might think
Review:  I have only 38k miles. My camshaft sensor went out in July of 2017, it took the shop two days to replace it and they never called me to say that they needed to keep my car another day. The techs at Putnam Cadillac don't like to talk to customers so they don't call them to inform them of pending repairs. A month after it was in the shop my Cue touch screen started dying and in two weeks was dead. I told them the Cue screen was dead when I dropped the car off yesterday. Today they finally called me after I called them for info. They said the Cue screen was dead, I said I knew that and had told them that yesterday. What's happening with it? The rep, Leo Yi, said he has the parts but he can't do anything until he speaks to his warranty administrator and she does not get in until tomorrow. Does that mean that every warranty job at Putnam Cadillac in Burlingame has to wait for this administrator to confirm the work can be done? Every job in the place must be backed up!                   The ATS is a fast car. The transmission is very slow to shift even in sport mode. The 3rd to 4th gear shift takes forever and often slips. This is common with most ATS's. It is Very small inside. If you are taller than 5'10", don't buy one. You will have a hard time getting into it. The very tiny trunk is only big enough for a gym bag or two. The CUE touchscreen system is terrible. Due to that particular issue, I cannot recommend this car. The touchscreen works sometimes and fails sometimes. You cannot turn on the A/C without the touchscreen. If you look at the Cadillac forums, you will see the frozen or dead Cue Touchscreen is a very very common problem.  Why they are not recalling the cars is beyond me. Consumer Reports needs to look into it.  It is nice looking car inside and out. Good paint. It handles well. But the poor touchscreen, poor dealer service, and getting in and out of the car without banging my head are reasons I would never own another.

Title: Issues with ATS  Local GM service excellent
Review:  I have owned my 2013 Cadillac ATS less than two months, yet have had a couple of issues with the car.  With that being said,  I have never received better service than my local GM service department has shown me.   The history of the car was a one owner (3 year lease) 32,000 miles.  The day I purchased the car and drove it home I smelled burning oil.   Noticed the next day there was oil on my garage floor.  I took to a GM service center, and they found the positive crankcase vent tube broken, replaced broken parts and installed two valves, yet after this was done there was oil dripping onto my garage floor.   Took to another GM service department closer to my home and they found oil leaking from the lower oil pan.  They resealed the oil pan and fixed the oil issue.  Two weeks later the car started shuttering when I accelerated between 25 to 40 miles per hour.  Took to my local GM service center, diagnosed issue as a torque converter chatter.   The service center replaced the torque converter.  The technician found a coolant leak while this work was being done and replaced the hose leaking.   All the work was covered under the existing bumper to bumper warranty.  My local GM dealership was awesome.  Their entire service department is a class act.  They went above and beyond to fix the issues with my car.**Update 6 months later....  No other issues with the car.  The work (repair and replacements) the local GM dealership completed on my car fixed all issues.  It's a fun car to drive, I have lots of compliments on this car.

Interior space is tight for backseat passengers but the driver and front passenger have loads of room (I'm 6'5" 250 lbs).  The CUE system is easily figured out and the My Cadillac app works great for starting car from my desk and downloading routes for upcoming trips.  Overall I am very impressed with my new baby.

Title: Eye catching styling
Review:  The ATS is a pleasure to drive. It handles well and is responsive. The interior is comfortable.  The exterior design is very eye catching and I've received compliments on the car. It has a good audio system with Boise sound. I'm very pleased with this car and would purchase another in the future.*Still love my car 5 years after purchase. As I walk to my car in a parking lot, I still get the pride of ownership feeling. Still get compliments from people as I drive it out in the public. The styling has not diminished with time. Would buy another ATS as its a beautiful car and very dependable.

Title: Dream Car or Nightmare?
Review:  I purchased this car in 2014 and thought my dreams had come true.  Beautiful car. Very classy. Sporty.  What a nightmare it has become.  CUE system SUCKS!  The CUE is frozen on the homepage and will cost $2K to repair.  Not covered under warranty.  Several recalls including rear defogger, transmission issues, etc. Of course there is no recall on the CUE.  Interior falling apart. Plastic parts just pop off. I'm collecting them for next owner. Driver seatbelt gets stuck.  The audio is horrible while using the phone via Bluetooth.  I'd rather hold my phone and drive.  Navigation is only available through OnStar and limited at that. Climate controls have a mind of their own.  While only using the AC, the heater will intermittently come on; even in 100 degree temperatures outside.  Needs frequent front-end alignments and I'm a careful driver (don't run over potholes).  I will NEVER buy another Cadillac.  Please save yourself LOTS of money and aggravation and "steer clear" of this one.

Title: This thing is a blast to drive
Review:  The ATS is really a fun to drive car. With the 321 hp  V6 it has plenty of power and with the trans in manual mode you can really wind it up through the gears. Handling is great, it really holds the road. I don't know why it is that GM puts summer only tires on vehicles  it sells in the north east. I had to replace them not long after I got it with all season, an extra expense. The one thing that I don't like about the car is the touch screen controls. You can't work the radio or climate controls by feel, you have to take your eyes off the road to make sure you hit the touch screen just right and sometimes that isn't easy. Over all I like the car and am enjoying it but I would say that it is not anything for a little old lady or anyone wanting a real cushy ride.

Title: Great entry luxury sedan
Review:  I am definitely on board with the Cadillac brand after this purchase. I have had the car for almost four months and loving every second of it. This car handles surprising well, even in rain I dont have to change the way I drive. Interior is great for the price tag. I can't say anything about the cue system, as mine does not have it, but I just connect my iPod to the USB port and leave it. So getting the touchscreen didn't appeal to me. The 2.0t engine is great. Having almost no turbo lag is great for hooning around backstreets. Transmission sometimes gets confused on when to shift when pushing the car hard, but manual shift gets rid of that. If your in the market for a4s or BMW 3 series but are slightly to expensive,this car used is a great choice and beats out the europeans cars if you ask me.

Title: The American Standard of Luxury not here.
Review:  I leased a 2013 Cadillac ATS 4 door Sedan turbo, The car has been nothing but problems from the start.We are talking about the American standard for luxury vehicles, obviously this car is not.I am not going to completely trash the car because it does have some good points such as the handling, acceleration,interior looks as well as an appealing exterior, definitely a great looking vehicle.But the CUE system is inoperable while driving for fear of getting too distracted or frustrated and getting into an accident. The radio is useless it's always acquiring the HD signal so it sounds terrible, every once in a while it loses all the pre-set stations.I had front end problems since the begining of my lease, the car is in the shop every few months for different problems, already had about 7 recalls, There is absolutely no pleasure in driving this car.As I write this it is in the shop for noise vibrations on engine and rear. They called me and told me that there were loose screws on engine/door as far as the back vibration is concerned they said that all 4 rims are bent due to the potholes on roads. Now this definitely doesn't sound right, I can understand one rim possibly getting bent/damaged but not all four of them this leads me to believe that there is an apparent design/structural fault or that the materials used are too weak to support the weight of the vehicle. I have owned/leased well over 15 different vehicles during my life and never had a problem where I was told that the rims were bent/damaged.This ATS has been nothing but headaches since we got it and I must say that the dealership has been no help.When I last contacted the owner of the dealership he told me that I should call Cadillac/GMC directly and complain to them so let me get this straight you buy the car and after that they are done with you so now when you have a complaint or problem you have to contact the manufacturer yourself. What is the point in buying from a dealership when they are not there to help you, we may as well be allowed to buy directly from the manufacturer since ultimately they are the ones that you have to deal with.Lastly I must say that my experience with this vehicle has been nothing but frustrating and overall unpleasant, what is the point of having a car that you have absolutely no joy or pleasure in driving. I would be willing to possibly understand having so many problems if the car was used but for a brand new car it does not appear to be reasonable and at this point the car only has 27,000 miles practically still pretty new.It’s 2018 and my review of the ats still stands.I have since leased a 2016 srx no problems, now leasing 2018 xt5 no problem.

Title: Love the truck but not the fuel mileage
Review:  I am a line driver for a local trucking company and when I get back to the yard I can't wait to get in my 2006 Chevy 2500HD. It is very comfortable to drive and has an abundance of power. It feels extremely stable on the road, its a dream to drive even compared to my wifes 2003 Tahoe. The one and only gripe I have with the truck is the fuel mileage, even though it sits at the yard most of the week it seems like all I do is put gas in that bottomless tank. I understand that you have to have a give and take for the power available but somewhere between 9 and 10 MPG is a little extreme. Bottom line I love my truck and will just bite the bullet and deal with the fuel issues.

Locking differential and auto 4WD make it fun and safe in the snow but a bit tough to turn sharply on dry pavement. Terrific heater and A/C.  Crew cab and step bars make it easy to accommodate 4 large adults.  Comfortable seats and ride.

I've had several trucks in the past, Ford, Chevy and Dodges, and this truck outdoes them all.  The outside look is great and I get compliments everywhere I go!  I have the front bucket seats with the console in the middle, which offers plenty of storage space.  It's very roomy inside and has a lot of head room.  The back seat seems to me much larger than my '06 Silverado Crew Cab.  The engine has more than enough giddy in it's step.  Fuel economy isn't to bad, about 17 on the highway.  My last 3 trucks were newer, but this one is by far the best!

Title: Best truck I've owned
Review:  Bought this truck new in September 2001.  Towed travel trailer thru 40 plus states and most of Canada.  Developed the startup knock on first trip to Nova Scotia.  Chevrolet gave me the 100K engine warranty.  Still has the startup knock but obviously has not affected the engine.  Replaced the spark plugs, alternator, battery and water pump.  Still has original brakes, front and back.  Recently developed the ABS brake light problem, apparently caused by a bad relay in the ABS module (not caused by bad body ground).  ABS is still operational when ABS and Brake warning lights are on.  Has had minor steering column rattle since new. dealer couldn't/wouldn't fix it. Otherwise, very happy with it.

Title: It'll beat a Hemi
Review:  I've had many Dodge and Chevy trucks in the past. I must say this is the best. I'm used to driving 400+ horsepower muscle cars, and I would consider this a "Muscle Truck". I would give the performance a 20 if it would let me. I does well at everything from hauling to plowing snow. Mine has the famous tap at startup also, but it's normal. It rides, drives and handles great. I would recommend this truck to anyone who wants to say they have a real truck. The gas mileage is so so for me but what do you expect with a full size truck with a 6.0L powerhouse under the hood. With a little add ons like I have, "It'll beat a Hemi"

Review:  Very happy with the truck.  The 1500 HD  is a perfect transition truck although  I'm not sure why they didn't just call  it a 2500 (non-HD) crew cab as it has  all the ratings and capacity of a  standard 2500.  Has a lot of common  sense type features and have had many  compliments on it.  Only partly  negative thing I'd say is that it just  doesn't stand as tall as the Fords and  Dodge trucks, although that is merely  for looks and serves no practical  purpose other than appearing its bigger  or stronger than it is.  In a drag  race, this truck is no slouch and the  Ford and Dodge commercials are  obviously biased.

Review:  This is a lot of truck but it does  have its flaws.  Given there is  limited availability for full four  door trucks from GM this is the best  option besides an Avalanche.  Overall  the truck is a joy to drive  with plenty of power.  The interior  is awesome with as many features as a  luxury car.  The only complaint is the  tapping in the engine.  This noise  Called "piston slap" usually is only  noticeable for the first 30 sec to a  minute until the engine warms.  I have  an 84 Ford F150 with 177K miles with  the same problem, knocks when it  starts then quits.  Every mechanic I  talk to says engine tapping is just  part of owning a Chevy.

Review:  Only about 8K on the clock, but no real problems yet. A few times now, the A/C blows warm for some reason but it's rare. There is some valve noise with this engine that some one else here is concerned about. I believe it to be normal. Some engines make more noise than others. Power is fantastic. Ride is decent. Pretty bumpy on these L.A. freeways, but the towing/hauling capacity beats Fords flat out. I compared to F250 and this 1500HD is superior in just about every way in terms of utility. Comparing this truck to the F150 4-door was a no brainer - The F150 5 foot bed was a big deterrent as I use this truck for motorcycles, etc.

Title: Satisfied Bowtie Owner
Review:  6 months and 5K miles later no major  c/o.  Happy from day 1 (low/no pressure  sales pitch) to now. Mine is loaded and  is more comfortable, and has more  features than my wife's Mercedes E-320  (no exaggeration).  Definitely  a "gentleman's" truck.  Wouldn't get it  to work on the farm (to many accessory  features that would have the potential  to break).  But as far as towing  ability (boat) and driveablility  couldn't imagine a finer ride.  Has the  auto-temp control, which the 2500  lacks, which is a big plus on road  trips (no constant knob turning).  Didn't think any other truck matched  this one, and still believe that.

Title: Heavy "D"
Review:  I waited 2 years for the Avalanche and when it finally hit the market it looked great, but was it practical for my needs as well as my wants? No. So I ended up with the Heavy "D". Almost identical to the Avalanche except for the plastic on the outside and the motor on the inside. The 1500HD comes standard w/ the 6.0L V8. Rides like a Cadillac. Powerful like a Corvette. Quiet inside.

Title: 1500HD
Review:  I rated the truck high because I like it. It may be lighter than the Heavy heavy dutys but it rides as good as my wifes $24.000.00 car. It's quite and runs good, with plenty of pep. The gas milage is around 13 intown and 16 on the highway. It sits as high as the 2500HD's and it looks good. But with a big truck your not going to get the milage like a small truck. But thats the price I'm willing to pay.

Title: Transmission Problems
Review:  I experienced transmission problems with this truck at 50000 miles, and had to totally replace it with a new trans out of pocket, not covered by any manufacture warranty. In addition, the check engine light keeps coming on, once you add a bottle of Heet or Engine cleaner into the fuel it goes off, until, fuel gets low and more is added. Then it starts all over again. Truck lugs down on slopes and looses speed, not a pulling type of truck.

Title: It takes a kicking and......
Review:  All around it's been a pretty awesome vehicle. I don't baby it at all. I tow an 11,000 lb. travel trailer regularly, I've used 4 wheel drive over 400 hundred continuous miles of ice, I've chained up through snow up to the bumpers, I've climbed into the mountains on some pretty steep and rocky terrain. I've had the steering column repaired twice, one rear seatbelt buckle and a nut fell out from under the dashboard. Haven't figured out where that came from yet. Gas mileage is usually around 12, but then I'm using it like a truck. If I wanted mileage I'd have bought a Honda and stayed on the highways.

It has never hydroplaned on me.  Very roomy inside and great for trips. Great speed acceleration with the 8 cylinder.  Makes it easy to speed up for entering the expressways. If you can afford the gasoline as it only gets about 18 miles to the gallon in the city, I highly recommend this truck and would definitely buy another.

Review:  For a large truck with the capabilities it has, this is the best value on the market.  Haul six people and a load of mulch while towing the tandem axle trailer with the bobcat and equipment, all while having the Bose jamming!  Wash it up and take it to dinner.  Loads of creature-comforts options with the durability and dependability of a Chevy.  Some might think the interior layout is boring.  However, beauty is in simplicity.  I don't need/want woodgrain stickers that peel off.  It's a truck.  Everything where it needs to be and not labeled with neon-green idiot labels

Paint started  peeling after a month, GM told me I did  something to it, not noticable to most  people but we know it's there.  POOR  gas mileage, 11 mpg anywhere I go.   Harder ride than my dads Ford 1 Ton  dually.  Knocks with 89 octane (use 91  and it goes away).  Auto shutoff at  96mph has to be fixed with a hypertech  unit to reach 127 actual top end.   Needs bigger stock tires for offroad  use.  No aftermarket lift kit that I  can find.

I test drove two other trucks before I showed this to my husband. He knew I was in love with it before I showed it to him. I love this truck. It drives like a 1/2 ton but has the power of a 3/4 ton. With the 6.0 engine and the 410 rear end I can pull my 16 foot stock trailer with all four horses in it like it's not even back there. When we go get hay. I can drive the trailer right out to the hay field and load it with 70-80 bales and get home with no problem. Ny husbands 4X4 Chevy 1/2 ton can't carry that much. It's a great truck.

Title: Work and Family
Review:  I needed a truck for plowing and occasional hauling. This truck is definitely not my daily driver due to it's poor fuel consumption. Speaking of which, I get typically 17mpg highway during summer (I have a green foot, so don't expect quite as much) which is decent IMO for a work truck. I still feel like they could do better. Interior is great despite it's plastic dash. Forgive it this though cause it is a work truck. But it definitely gives you luxury too: Decent stereo, comfy leather seats, pretty quiet on the HWY. Load up the back and it is almost as smooth as my wife's Escalade! IMO, engine should be SOHC. 300hp out of 6.0 is poor--6.0 HO in the Escalade is FANTASTIC!

Review:    I have enjoyed this truck very much.  I pull a 21 ft deck boat with it and it has no problem even in the hills of Arkansas.  Chevy needs to come up with a new int. design but it is still nice and confortable, even on long trips.  I wish it got better gas mileage, (12-13 in town and 15-16 on the road.) the best was 17mpg. Pulling our boat, 9-10mpg. Keep the rpms down and it will do better, but it has to be babied to do so.  As much as I love it I am thinking about selling it only because of the gas prices.  If you have the money for gas, and want a super truck, then this truck is for you.

The interior leather is well  done and the layout of the dash, etc,  couldn't be better.  I love this truck! The only issue is with mileage.  I get  about 13 in town and 14.7 on highway,  which is terrible.  My 1978 C10 comes  within 2-3 miles per gallon without  the benefit of 25yrs of evolution!

Review:  My last chevy gave me 340,000 miles of service b efore I decided to trade up.  I am convinced that m y new truck will be every bit as reliable and give m e many years of service.  I have had zero issues t o have serviced in my first 35,000 miles.  My o nly complaint is the fuel mileage.  I average a bout 14 miles per gallon.  This is a very large t ruck - crew cab - 4wd - so perhaps I am being t oo picky.  I think if I had to do it over again, I w ould get the deisel simply because of the gain in m ileage.

Title: Like the QUARDASTEER
Review:  I took the delivery of a 2003 1500HD  4x4 crew cab with Quadrasteer on July  27, 2003. In that time I have put more  than 3500 miles on the truck. My  previous truck was a 1-ton crew cab  long bed 4x4 but this one drives  circles around the old. At 300 hp and  only weighting 4600 lb it out performs  my old truck in all areas. The Dana  rear end is great. Rides a little  rough on some of the L.A. and Orange  County freeways but it is a truck.

Title: One Handling Chevy  Truck
Review:  The Quadrasteer ROCKS.  This is my 8th Chev 4X4.  Although the IFS is not the off roader that the pre 88's were, this is an awesome truck.  The power is awesome, but the mileage is poor around town.  I have a  8 1/2' camper made for the short box with a full queen over cab and a 18' boat and it handles them like a dream. With the load it does not affect the mileage much.  The Quadrasteer is great with or without a load.  I like it so much i don't even drive in 2 wheel steer.

Review:  This truck is great.  I traded in my  2002 Z71.  The power in this truck is  incredible.  However, the gas mileage  is not impressive.  I put a Magnaflow  Catback exhaust to increase gas  mileage and it did not work although I  did get 20 more horses.  I am going to  put a K & N filter.  I heard that  improves the gas mileage.  So far I  love the truck!

It is  fun to ace-out folks for tight parking  spots and whip a U turn on a dime.  I  was very concerned buying a year 1  feature, but my experience has be very  positive so far.  The Crew Cab is very  roomy.  Why would anyone ever buy an  SUV when you can get a truck like  this.  I am very pleased.

Title: One problem, but overall Excellent
Review:  I got my truck on Dec 2002.  It has had  only one problem, which the dealer said  they've had problems before.  The speed  sensor went out and gave me a "Service  4x4" note on the odometer.    For the most part I've used it for city  driving, but I like to snow ski.  On  the ice and snow the auto 4x4 handles  excellent.  I've gone in 2 feet of snow  and 2 feet of mud.  I must say,  shifting it to 4x4 LO makes the truck  jump out of either mud or snow.    Towing, I've not done much, but the  main reason I got a 1500HD is to tow a  possible boat in the future.

Title: Nice
Review:  I have had this truck 3 days now and  must say that it seems to be very well  made. Its my first 4x4 and I tell ya I  didn't now it would ride as stiff as it  does. I have the 4.1 gearing and that  even feels different from the other  trucks that I have owned. Its got great  looks. I don't like the fact that GM  has cut some corners in the interior  especially on the LT model. For  instance the sun visor doesn't have the  little flip down mirror and the carpet  is that cheap crap not like the thick  plush carpet in my suburban, no spare  tire lock seems that is an extra. The  center console is much smaller than I  am used too.

There  is a rattle in the passenger door,   The switch for the dome light is bad  on one of the rear doors so the light  never turns off.

Review:  I cannot say  enough about the performance of this truck. Purchased for hauling a 16,00lb 6 horse trailer. I have done 4 2500 mile trips in this truck, basically driving none stop each trip, and never had a single hiccup. Power, braking, etc. are excellent. Pulled through the Rocky Mountains without any drama, basically you forget you are pulling a trailer with this truck. My trailer brakes went out on one trip and it was not an issue with the tow haul mode, and the trucks braking power. The truck pulled a loaded trailer in excess of 85 MPH effortlessly.

Review:  If anything, better than my 2002 2500 hd 4door long bed. Pulls my Montana 5th wheel like a dream, and as a new vehicle not broken in, I got nearly 11mpg between Albany and Syracuse, NY, but down to 9 through the Catskills. Most comfortable seats ever (my other car is a Ford ambulance). It seems to be the quietest diesel out there. OnStar is great and hooks right in with Verizon with the family plan. OnStar safe and sound is great. Love the heated seats, and the dual zone AC is great. It means the wife and I are both comfortable. The DVD keeps the grand kids occupied. Multiple mode sound means I listen to my CD's, the kiddies can use wireless for the movie, and 2 headphones for others.

The new Duramax is so quiet it is often mistaken for a gas engine. The power is equal to the Ford, the seats are more comfortable, so in closing I would say to look at the Duramax dually before you buy.

Tons  of power, very smooth ride even with  the DRW, and for such a big engine it  gets fantastic mileage of 13 - 14 mpg.  If you're towing, this is the truck  for you.  You can spend thousands up  front for a diesel or save a little  and go with the gas.  Diesels are fine  but I went with the gas as they warm  up quicker in the winter.  Very good  truck and would recommend to anyone.

Add a few lil  performance mods to the engine and  holdon for ride (seems odd to others  that i have a dually racing by them)  i can tow anything ive been told to  with no lag on this truck it always  give the same great ride.

Title: BIG BLOCK DUALLY
Review:  This has been a great truck. It has  plenty of power with the 8.1 motor and  the Allision transmission. I am  thinking of tradeing it in only to  replace it with the same truck but with  the Duramax diesel. I wish that the gas  motor would do a little better on MPG.  I can get around 12 MPG on the high way  not towing. If I pull my 10,000 lb.  trailer the best it can do is 8.5 MPG.  I have talked to owners of the duramax  and they can get 20 MPG!!! I like my big block and it has plenty  of power but, gas is over $2.00 a  gallon now so what can I do? I did not  want to spend the extra $6000 for the  diesel when I bought my truck.

Review:  I purchased an '05 3500 this year, and I have nothing bad to say about my truck. I have always been a Ford man, but after hearing about their problem with that 6.0 powerstroke motor, I decided to go with the Duramax, and let me tell you, it is the most fuel efficient, most powerful and responsive diesel I have ever had. I've gone though three different super dutys, and I am over the headaches with the Fords. The Ford may look meaner, but I have high hopes for my new Chevy.

Title: DISAPPOINTED CHEVY OWNER
Review:  I am very disappointed with my purchase of the Chevrolet 4X4 crew cab 3500 pickup. I am towing about 8000 lbs on a regular basis and traded a 2004 Toyota Tundra for the Chevy.  This truck rides okay when not towing, but hook a 26' trailer to it and the ride is so uncomfortable you have to pull over every hour or so or it will beat you to death.  It averages 7-9mpg and seems to top out at 60 mph on slight inclines.  The Tundra by far is a better vehicle more leg room and the overall package is 100% better than Chevrolets "best towing truck"  It is too bad as I have been a long time Chevrolet owner but this will be the last.

My wife enjoys the heated seats, the OnStar feature, the leather interior and the DVD player. My future endeavor with my vehicle will be to see how a 39 foot Montana fifth wheel trailer is pulled. Can't wait. I recently took it out of town about 300 miles pulling through the grapevine, was a dream while leaving the other vehicles in my rear view mirror. Looking forward to taking it to the snow in Nevada. I looked at the rest and this is the best.

Title: Great truck
Review:  I drive this truck as my primary vehicle.  It has plenty of power when towing less then 12000 pounds or so.  IFS front suspension is much softer then earlier 3500's.  It has a decent ride for a one ton.  The 6 speed manual trans. is a lot of fun.  First gear is very low and will get even the heaviest trailers rolling.  Quiet inside the cab.  Radio controls on the steering wheel are very nice to have.  4WD works easily and always locks in fast.  Steaeo is nice for a truck.  Good fuel economy.  About 19 MPG highway (bobtail), and 17 MPG city.  You could improve those numbers by staying off the throttle a bit.  Brakes are very heavy duty.  Worn less then 50% at 86000 miles.  Nice truck.

It is a little rough to use as a  standard mode of transportation when  not performing as a tow vehicle as the  ride is stiff due to it's stiff  suspension etc.  The comforts in the  cab as far as leather, power seats,  Bose sound system, On-star, heated  seats etc. makes life a bit easier on  long trips. I make long trips for my  employment which involve coast to coast  travel many times, this vehicle's  ability to do that job in relatively  good comfort and convience of operation  makes me a happy owner.

Review:  Chevy missed its chance.  Cheap typical American car interior and materials.  If the sun is out you cannot see the Nav.  Talking about  the Nav. it seemed about three years out of date when the car was new.  Chevy needs to learn from Japan.  The sound system has the same issue, just ok when it could have easily been great for not much more money.  Sorry no I-Pod connection here.  Controls are not on wheel either, this had become the norm on a new car.  Run flats hold ok but create a hard ride, last 18000 and cost $500. each.  My tranny was fine then just failed, in shop for 6 weeks and now 200 miles later has failed again. Thank god for my extended warranty. lots of little problems.

Review:  The Z06 is truly a supercar that not only performs as well as cars costing hundreds of thousands, but beats most of them on the track and around town. I demand performance and drive mine fairly hard. My Z06 never lets me down, whether zipping through the curvy mountain roads at insane speeds or in stoplight to stoplight g-force fun. Also, I don't know where the mpg rating comes from in this listing, but I never get lower than 21-22 mpg average for a tank, and I get about 28-29 while cruising the highways at 74 mph. On a recent trip to Kentucky, I drove for 1200 miles and averaged 25 mpg, even though they were very mostly hard-driven miles. Interior is only okay. Build quality is awful.

I hear of buyers who want to quiet the car and make it more comfortable to drive. Give me a break. Why did you buy this car in the first place? After GM spent millions making the car lighter these buyers add sound deadening material.  If your not used to driving high performance cars don't buy this car or be prepared to learn since traction can be difficult to come by even with traction control on. Also, you guys that have to ride around in plush leather living room furniture buy a Maserati.

MPG is great, as I have made several long trips and averaged 26.7 mpg. Who needs a hybrid? The heat of the center console is tolerable for a while, then move your leg, just too hot. The faster I went in this rocket the better the handling felt. Taking mountain roads with signs saying 25 mph or 35 mph on tight curves and even hairpins at twice that speed was nothing for this car. Have had two other makes of American built so called rockets back down from this car.

The car is a true supercar but totally reliable.  It runs just like any other regular Corvette but the 505 horsepower is absolutely like a thrill ride at the amusement park.  The worst part is replacement of the supersoft run flat tires.  Insurance is not bad considering the car but I also have a perfect driving record.

Title: The best car ever made in the US
Review:  The car is so much fun to drive, handles turns very well it's like a stealth jet. This is my 5th vVtte and by far the best ever made. The biggest downfall is the mark up dealers put on these cars. Other than that the car is a ten. By far the best ever. 505 hp is enough for the averge Joe like me! If you can afford the car then is a must to have .

Title: Ron's Z06
Review:  My Velocity Yellow 2006 ZO6 is my 14th Corvette and is the best of the group by far.  I owned a couple of ZR1s and 3 Z06s and there is no comparison to this beast.  Chevy keeps improving the Vette with each generation and each model year.  The car is as tame or as wild as you want it to be.  It is great around town or on the road.

This is the "baddest" Vette ever. I can't say enough nice things about this car. My wife thinks this car is to powerful. Keep it comming Chevrolet.

Review:  This car is unbelievable!  One stomp on the gas at 3,500rpm or higher is the thrill of a lifetime - under 3,500 - fun and tame!  Great gas mileage and the power is extreme if you demand it.  Fabulous build quality and design.  I have never had a car I enjoyed more.  I will keep this the rest of my life as a weekend fun machine.  Can't believe I actually got one - 2nd one my dealer got.

Title: The closest thing to a fighet jet 
Review:  This car is an amazing car! 70 grand and able to beat Ferrari's, Lambo's and some of the world's fastest cars. It can turn in with the best of them and then run on the straight lines.   0-60 in just 3.8 seconds is what I was able to pull off. I took this car to the track an I was ahead of cars that cost in excess of 100K. I love the Head Up Display (HUD), it allows you to see your RPMs and speed without your eyes leaving the road, everything is in the perfect place, shifter, pedals, steering wheel and the seats hold you in while you pull those 1G turns an still allow you to be comfy on long drives. Gets looks from everyone and sounds great. Turn the HUD on and floor it at the stop light

Review:  This is my third Z06.  I must say that I have been very surprised by the level of quality in the whole car. Every feature has been tweaked, improved or replaced. The interior is top notched.  Every surface feels better to the touch. Since this one is based on the coupe it will now will allow me to carry larger items in the back which is amazing for a super car. This car is very efficient, comfortable, fast, affordable and athletic. The list of exotic materials in this car is simply amazing. The powerplant is this car is built with incredible strength and ability. I drove other cars in its performace range but the Z06 out shines them overall.

Title: Problems with owning an '06 Z06 Corvette
Review:  I have had nothing but problems with this car.  Starter needs replacing.  I had on road assistance called twice because the car didn't start.  2 & 1/2 months of owning this car and I'm informed that the "engine is cracked".  I speak with mechanics & the dealership and I'm informed that this happened on installation at the factory as there was overtorquing that cracked the lower engine block.  I was shown the problem visually.  It's as clear as day which is another testimony to GM's & Chevrolet's quality control which is anything but.  Nevertheless,  they refuse to replace the car although its obvious that the car was delivered defective.  GM is willing to replace the engine.

Title: Unreal
Review:  What an experience! Just picking up this beauty at the dealership was an experience. Had to go to NY to get this baby, was too much over list here in Miami. Drove car straight through overnight back to Miami from NY to avoid snowstorm.  This is the car I have been waiting for my whole life. Had the 1969 427 with trips - brand new when I was young. What a difference between a 69 with the SAME 7 liter displacement and this new beauty. Don't know how they got the mileage from this new LS7 engine, remember very POOR mileage on my first Vette.  Got so many stares and looks and the SOUND is INCREDIBLE! Every stop during trip home, found people standing around admiring the car. SOOOOO HAPPY!

She is 100% pure German Mercedes, with with nothing of Chrysler in her, except the name. For those that don't believe, lift her hood & check out the 12 spark plugs on her 6 cylinder engine.

Review:  This was wife's car became mine. She's gone. Love being in this machine. A real headturner, get's a lot of attention. The cupholder does work once you get used to it. Yes, the Console isn't a high point, yet you can upgrade to almost any material ie wood. Legroom is short and I'm maybe 5'10". Still it's seats are good for a roadster. Put aftermarket Chip in and yes it was quicker but electric fan always stayed on. Took it out. Don't miss the little extra HP. Drove SLK 320 liked Crossfire better cause it looks better yet could not find extra price value with the MB. Ex wants car back. Would like to buy it. NO WAY MAN

Title: What a Car!
Review:  The car is fun to drive.  The power for such a sample car is unbelievable.  The gas mileage is reasonable and the craftsmanship is outstanding. Some of the problems is that it only has one cup holder in the cabin.  Also when getting the oil changed, if you don't do it yourself, be ready for a shock.  The filter is $31.00.  The engine takes 8.5 quarts of 0 W 40 which is not cheap.  So the total cost for a change will run between $110 to $120.  But the enjoyment of the car is well worth the price.

The car is great once you get it out of first gear (they should have combined 1st and 2nd, you have to shift too quickly), has styling that gets a "Nice car!" at least once a day, and has gas mileage that is much better than I was expecting of around 22-24 mpg.

Title: Crossfire Limited Convertible
Review:  Purchased Spring, 2007 for daughter. This car has it all; looks, ride, power and safety features. For the price, we could not find a similar convertible with all these features.  The dealer incentive was the selling point.  We are pleased with the gas mileage, upper 20's on the highway and lower 20's in city. The only negative point has been a small water leak near the top and drive window. Expect to get this repaired easily.

Title: sporty vehicle but with problems
Review:  This model car has a history of electrical problems, and mine is no exception. I've spent over $4000 trying to solve one problem that it still has--it frequently won't start on the first try--turn the key and you get nothing--no lights, no sounds, no start. I've replaced every item in the starting system without changing the no-start situation. Hot/cold weather, long-term parking, frequent use, all have no effect on the starting problem. I've discovered that when it won't start (about one time in a half-dozen attempts), pumping the clutch 2-3 times usually solves the problem. Twice I've gone outside and found the flashers working on the left side of the car without being turned on. Had to disconnect the battery.

Review:  I began my quest for a sports car in the fall of 07 and was sold and ready to buy a Saturn Sky when a friend suggested that I give the Crossfire a try Thank God for suggestions, the car is such a great ride. Driving this car is like becoming part of the vehicle, you become one with the seat and thus the car itself. I am so glad I found this vehicle. The car is a brand new 2006 with  13 miles on it and I have only had it for 2 weeks but the car is sexy, curvy,sleek and so retro in design. I love this car and I absolutely love driving it. It is a true head turner. Thanks for the dream come true.

Title: A supercar for most folks
Review:  Coming up on a year with this car, and have had nothing but good experiences. No glitches, just a nice commuter vehicle for my wife and I. Very nimble, and fast enough to suit me-the numbers suggest it will accelerate as fast as my old '89 Trans Am, but I'm out of the "rat race".  Tires are still in very good shape, and just 2 oil changes for maintenance.  A few negs-the seat is probably better in the Limited model, so maybe a retro fit is in order-this one generates complaints from my lovely wife of 31 years.  And the radio is annoying.  As we know now, the car has been killed by the new Chrysler. I guess a notchback version with a removeable window is out of the questions now, eh?

Title: What a deal
Review:  I bought this on a whim when I was looking for a Mazda 3 wagon a year ago. The $19k price tag was a deal maker.  Driving it is a treat and I'm still impressed with its handling, braking and looks. The 6 speed manual taps the power in the engine efficiently and it feels great to be pressed back into the seat upon acceleration. The only drawback is that is does not go up icy hills well so it's garaged when it snows.  My 6'3" tall husband cannot strech his legs out straight, but he is very willing to make the sacrafice. Cargo area is plentiful for everyday and weekend jaunts. I swore I would never own a Chrysler product but this is the best car I've ever had.

Like a super hot girlfriend, you overlook her bad habits because you're having so much fun!  Some car reviewers have said the car's chassis and brakes are so good that It could use more power. I'm sure not complaining. I think it's a blast to drive yet, unlike most performance cars I've had, it is very forgiving. The ESP/Traction Control/ABS systems work very well especially in bad weather. It really makes you feel like a hero.

I constantly get asked about my baby at gas stations,stores, etc....For 215 horses, this thing can fly. Premium gas adds up as does expensive oil change with 8.5 quarts of rare 0W-40 oil.

Title: Best Car For The Money
Review:  I bought my 2004 Crossfire not long ago purely by chance. I had pulled into a used car lot to look at a Porsche Cayenne when my wife spotted the Crossfire. Turns out the dealership had just repossessed the car and offered it to me for what was owed on it. The price was so reasonable I couldn't turn it down. I have had many sports cars and my last toy was a Jaguar XK8 but have had several Porsche, Jags and others that cost much more. While at 60 it isn't the easiest car to get in and out of it isn't too bad and somewhat expected. I had loved the way the XK8 had performed and I was surprised that the Crossfire actually performs even better. It is just a great looking and fun car to drive. Me not being content to leave any car alone I have replaced the stereo with one that has bluetooth and have done a few other things and will do more as I am looking at putting in a dash kit in carbon fiber as while okay I think it will dress it up inside a little. I have also ordered a performance chip although the car is already fast enough without it.Looks, style and performance at an affordable price, what more could you ask for.

Title: Awesome car for the price
Review:  Bought the 04 model because everything was standard that year. Not a daily driver for a guy 6'3 (6'0 probably the limit) but I bought it for weekend use on backroads and getaways .  I like it's uniqueness in my area and it's rarity in the world. Yes you can find better performers, but not for less the double what i paid. The brakes approach supercar status with it's stopping power and the Mercedes drivetrain is a big plus. My car has 93k on it but most of those miles were between 04 and 2012 so I had it inspected by my mechanic and he found no issues.  A fun car and well worth the price if your looking for a coupe on a budget.

Review:  I felt compelled to review based upon a touch of misinformation I've seen out there; if you want this car you should have no worries about buying a well-maintained one. I was not looking for this car but, when I found it I instantly fell in love! The car is fun to drive, plenty powerful (you won't be beating Corvettes in it - if you want to race high-power sports cars get something else), and handles much better than my BMW 330 did. Two issues I'd like to speak to: the engine mechanicals are a bit loud - relax, you're not about to throw a rod! Rearward visibility obviously isn't like a mini-van, but you'll acclimate to it quickly. If you want one, buy one, you be glad you did!

The back hatch door rattles real bad and mine has etched through the paint where the hard rubber has worn through it.  I wish it had an off switch for the back fin.  It's distracting, embarrassing and blocks your view in the rear view mirror.  Other than that it's been a fun driver!

Review:  I just bought my 2004 Crossfire in August, and simply love it! Due to our snowy Canadian winters, I had to park it for about 5 months, but cannot wait to uncover her and hit the freeways again. It turns heads wherever I go, and people just stare and ask what it is constantly. I am only 5'8", so getting in and out are a breeze. It handles like it is on rails, and makes every trip fun! I know it's not as fast as the 350Z or TT, but I feel it is a much sharper looking car, and lives up to the Mercedes name in every way. I have driven Jags and high end Acuras, and this car feels and looks more expensive. If you have the chance, buy one and hold on! This is a future collector's car for sure!

This vehicle surpasses any other car I've owned to include a BMW z3. It's not the fastest but then again who really is?!  The car handles flawlessly and Ive found myself pushing upwards to 80mph on back country twisties. It gets looks everywhere I go and best of all there aren't a lot of them around unlike the "me-too" Mustangs. Only problem was my own doing as I put an aftermarket exhaust which causes occasional vibration/resonnance but the car sounds like it should for the looks. It's destined to be a classic! No more built after 2008

Title: I love my Crossfire
Review:  I was searching for a cute, reliable, economical sports car. Ruled out Infiniti and the Nissan 350 for this wonderful Crossfire. I purchased my 2004 in 2007 at a really good price were it only had 25K miles on it. The body had no nicks or scratches and looked brand new. It has been a fun car to drive and I always get positive comments on this looker. However, maintenance can be pricey being that everything under the hood is Mercedes.

Title: 25,000 miles and still happy
Review:  My Crossfire has all of the build quality and reliability you would expect-- but rarely get from a German made car. After 25k miles there are no rattles or squeaks, mechanically it hasn't missed a beat, and the factory original tires (Continentals) have only just given up the ghost. The car is a sports car, not a grand touring car, and as such has some sports car short comings, chief of which is a slightly cramped interior package. Anyone over 6ft will find that this isn't the best long distance car on the road. But for short jaunts and weekend escapes it is pretty much unbeatable. Excellent (but not superb) handling combined with "one of a kind" styling makes the Crossfire a joy to own.

Title: Amazing Sports Car
Review:  Granted, Chrysler only lent its name to this car for, without a doubt it is a thoroughbred. with a few performance modifications and a few changes here and there, you have a world class sports car. There is no doubt about who built this car, it's German heritage shines through in performance and design. Simply stated, this car is absolutely fantastic from its brilliant skin to it's impressive manners and a plush interior that isn't found in many cars 3 times it's price. I'm in love with motoring all over again.

Title: Just awesome
Review:  I love this car. I have tons of fun driving it on the highway, but the real rush is on country back roads. The car hugs the road. I drive hard and fast, and I almost never hear the tires (especially over the more than ample stereo). The wing that comes up at around 60 mph lets me know that I might want to back off the accelerator, but I usually don't. Its interior is small, but I mean come on look at the car. The controls are difficult to figure out, but easy to use, and there is a cup holder hidden in the center console. The vehicle isn't that bad in the snow and ice either (it has a winter mode, but don't try busting through snow drifts). Overall, its a steal for any true 2 seater.

Title: Thanks car magazines!
Review:  Car magazines hate my car.  Thanks to them, the value of my vehicle was greatly lowered.  (they drove down the value of the vehicle.)  Because of that, I purchased a luxury sports car at the price of a Kia!  The car is perfect for me, and I paid less than 1/2 its value when it was 1.5 years old, with only 4000 miles on it.  It is better than any other sports car I tried:  better than 350Z, Madza, TT, Honda, etc.  Only the Porsche Boxster was better, and it would have cost me 2x as much.  The car has speed, great handling, great looks (everybody stares when I drive by), and  great gas mileage.  It also has great trunk space no other sports car can match.  Thanks motortrend, car&driver, etc

Review:  I have had this car for just a short time but have so far enjoyed every driving minute. I'm 6'4" and fit. I have always liked the styling but would never have paid the initial price. I purchased mine with only 18,000 miles on it - not bad for three years old.  It was as clean as brand new. The miles and condition along with a price tag of less than half of the new MSRP made it irresistible.

Review:  I bought this car used a few years after its debut. I loved it from the beginning but prices came down to the point I could grab one. I'm glad I did. This is a very fun car with a passionate design and a character all its own. I've had small mechanical issues (squeaky window, loose shift knob) but no major problems. Fast. Handles beautifully. Quiet for this type of car.  Standard traction and stability control made winter driving much easier than I expected.  No problems.

Title: A bargain basement Benz
Review:  I have admired the styling of the Crossfire since it's introduction. However, I found the $35K price a bit steep. However, the marketplace has spoken and this car is avaialable used at bargain prices. I picked up my 2004 Crossfire autostick with 5400 miles on it for under $18K. Immaculate condition. Considering that is the price of a boring old Civic, I grabbed one. Since this is a Benz SLK with pretty sheetmetal, it does inherit some of the old SLK's shortcomings. The interior is cozy, but I am 6'1" and 270# and am very comfortable in this car. The console is cheap and chintzy, and the cupholder is a joke, but the car drives superbly. 25MPG, and no problems, I love this car!

Title: The truth
Review:  Since I have had this car it has been a lot of fun. I have only had to problems with this car. One was the door had rust building up due to the weather striping not being properly put on. The warranty took care of this. The other was the car has no spare tire. I had a blow out and no way to fix it. Since Chrysler does not offer a good road side assistance program on flat tires for a car that they make with no spare tire, I had to leave it on the side of the road and wait for help at 3:30 am . At the end total bill was $995.00 including the tire. Don't get me wrong I love the car, however I will never buy a Chrysler again due to the warranty leaving me stuck out. Glad it was me not my wife.

Title: Couldnt wait to get rid of my Crossfire!
Review:  My lease on this vehicle ended in June 07 but I traded it in earlier because its such a nightmare to drive.  While this car handles and accelerates very well on the highway its a nightmare to ride in the city.  Potholes will make you bounce all over the road and getting the tires to stick around turns can be quite a gamble.  If you are tall just forget buying this car unless you don't mind your knees touching the dash!

Just replaced the tires and getting an air intake for 10+ more horses and better mileage. Only thing I do not like is I am 6'2 and the seats could go back just a little more but I fit in ok. Quick, good cornering, quiet comfortable ride, aggressive rumble from the exhaust, sytlish and all around a good car thus far. As someone mentioned they could have put the cruise control in another place because when I got the car I used it instead of the blinkers for the 1st month...

Dropping down using auto stick I can pop your head back at 60 mph.  Good mileage too.  Premium gas stings a bit but that wasn't the point of buying a car like this.

Title: Good car
Review:  This Acura RLX  has been a great vehicle for my family. The good part of the ownership experience is the size of this car. I am 6'-2" and I am very happy with the legroom I have on both front and rears seats. The car is much more roomier  than appears on outside. I can complement on the quality of the interior materials; it is made very nice, the cabin is surrounded by by soft materials wrapped in the high quality leather; there are not many plastic parts around like in the similar class Lexus car. Very comfortable large seats, I like them better and think they are more comfortable than E-class Mercedes; nice large armrests. The control buttons and vents don't seem wear off like on most of European luxury cars.  This car has a very sensitive breaks; it will stop dead in a very short time. One of the best features I like is the headlights. The optics of the headlights  "jewel eye" look very attractive and deliver one of the best driving experiences at night; road signs reflections look  like LED TV screens.  Infotainment system is great and very easy to use. I found it much more convenient than E-class Mercedes. I like rolling volume control on the steering wheel instead of + -- volume bottoms. I like touch screen and how it gives vibrating feedback. I don't know why so many "expert" reviews are complaining about how confusing the infotainment system is. I found it very easy to use. I like the climate control in this car. The front seats heat up very fast and air fans are very quiet in a high mode, unlike Mercedes or BMW. The average gas mileage is 23 mph in mixed city/highway use which is very very good for this size car with 310 hp engine.  So far I don have any mechanical or electrical problem with this car.  Very, very reliable car 5+++.          Now about the negative experience: First, suspension, suspension, suspension. The car drives like an Amish buggy on a bumpy road. 19 inch wheels with low profile tires make it even worst. The rear suspension is so stiff it sends pain in my spine every time the car goes over a bump. It is far from a luxury riding experience. I wish they have sport and comfort suspension modes to switch. I think this stiff suspension helps to transmit road noise to the car's body even though Acura advertises its noise cancellation technology and hollow wheels which suppose to reduce the road noise. However, I cannot say there is much road noise, but I am sure Mercedes E an Cadillac CTS is more quiet.   Second is the gear shifting. It is also rough. When I try to accelerate fast, every time the gear shifts it rocks my body back and forth.  Third, is the gear ratios. The car quickly goes to very high RPM during even mild acceleration. It creates unnecessary engine noise and makes it hard to control the car on the road.  During "normal" driving mode the car acts like most of luxury cars would act in the "Sport" transmission mode. Forth, is the line departure alarm, blind spot and breaking warning alarms. I wish Acura change it from beeping sound warning alarm to vibration warning like it is done in Cadillac or Lexus cars. When I listen to music or radio, all these warnings become useless; I just cannot hear the beeping warning sound while music is playing. Fifth, the exterior assembly quality. The body parts are not lined as is suppose to be lined. Rear trunk lid does not line with rear fenders, I checked with dealer and it appears on all 2014 RLX models. Front hood/fender gaps are not consistent.  It gives an impression like this car has been in a car rack and having some frame damage.  After driving this car for 115K the P-AWS RTC actuators began to moan when making small turns. It is not critical, but I know I have to replace them soon. The bottom line is: I like this car and I think I will keep it for a couple more years. I would not recommend this car for a person who likes comfortable Cadillac-style ride. However, for a younger person who likes to drive fast alone, for aggressive  driving style it could be a good choice.

Car has low resale value as my experience does not appear to be unique.  So I have to chalk this up to a very expensive lesson.  While the car is disappointing the response of the dealership and Acura/Honda customer service was more  disappointing.  Acura buyer beware.

I suspect it's a parasitic draw, possibly from the HFL module. Taking it back to the dealer and plan to leave it with them until they fix it. Apparently this is a problem with Acuras and I will not recommend buying this model, or any of the other ones, until they address it.

Title: Drives Great "IF" You Can Get it to Start!
Review:  Purchased my 2014 RLX in May 2014.  Other than the fact that the engine was kind of loud, and the car did not come with a spare tire of any kind, I was in love with my RLX the first time I drove it.  My favorite feature is the All Wheel Steering; I love the way the car handles.  What I don't love is that something keeps draining the battery.  The first time my car failed to start was in Jan 2015, eight months after I purchased it.  This happened again in Sep 2015. The car was completely dead both times; wouldn't make a sound.  I had to call Acura roadside assistance to jumpstart the car each time.  The car was taken to the dealership after each incident and they could not find what was causing the battery to drain, or any other problem with the vehicle.  I have also had problems with the touch screen going blank, Forward  Collision Warning activating for no reason,  the Bluetooth/phone screen not responding, and voice activation not working properly.  The Navigation system doesn't work very well either, once you "finally" figure out how to use it.  I have had several problems trying to get the system to find addresses.  The search feature doesn't do a good job of keying in on your current area for requested searches, not to mention, maps are outdated.  As much as I like the Acura RLX, It is unreliable, so I would not recommend it to a friend or anyone else for that matter.

Title: Bad design or bad quality?
Review:  I bought my RLX-ADV about 4 months ago and only put on about 1500 miles so far. I have already took it back three times for repair. There were iPhone 4S issue (automatic dial out and hang out), low battery and charging system warning sign(happened in less than first 50 miles), and camera too hot/LDW, LKAS shut down (90 degree outside) during driving. Dealer recharged the battery, but no action to other issues. Dealer and Acura insisted the shut down is the proper action by design. SF Bay Area is known for good climate. The LDW, LKAS shut-down happened multiple times in April. I really wonder what the car would do in Summer! Update on May 2016:Here are updates on the issues I reported. After two battery charging visits,, my dealer finally declared that it had a bad battery. I got a new battery in less than 12 months since owning the car. The charging issue was resolved. I do not have any phone issue now, either. It went away after I upgraded my phone to iPhone 6S. Honestly, this might be a problem of Apple, not Acura. However, the most important LDW & LKAS shut-down persists! It consistently shutting down these important safety features when outside temperature is around 90 degrees. I gave up fighting with Acura since they insisted this is a necessary precaution to protect the delicate electronic system. I am really disappointed. I spent extra money on this car since it was promised with these safety features. Acura sold me an ill-designed product that takes protection of car as priority over the driver!Update on May 2017:The LDW & LKAS shut-down is still a big problem! I have already experienced twice this year. Both times occurred when the temperature went up to low 90's. I am an unsatisfied customer of Acura!

Title: RLX Rattles down the road since purchase- no solution
Review:  I noticed rattles coming from front suspension after 500 miles. Brought it to the dealership and they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Dealership reported service rep had the same problem but worse after 7k miles. After another 2k miles the rattles increased in frequency and loudness from all 4 wheels. Dealership replaced front struts which resolved a majority of the rattle but the rear rattle persisted. After another visit, the replaced the rear rattle. The rear is better but now the front is ever present over every bump. When I had a 2014RLX loaner the vehicle had the same issue as both mine and the service reps car. Cant believe engineering isn't all over this issue. Beware of RLX.

My wife got the '13 Lexus GS 350, which is very nice, but I needed more testosterone.I was very surprised when I test drove the RLX as most of the reviews by the 'experts' were average at best.. It is a perfect fit for me. Bigger inside than my TL and the Lexus 350. Lots of room in the back seat. The control panel is much more intuitive than my TL. The ride is plenty smooth, the transmission feels great shifting in all gears, A/C is perfect. I really enjoy driving it. I leased it and did not know until I was handed the keys it comes with a great Roadside Assistance Pkg. basically covers everything.

Review:  I test drove just about every luxury sedan in this price range--BMW, Audi, Lexus, Infinity, Porsche (suv), and some midlevel sedans as well, and I can honestly say this is the best one out there.  Why?  Well,....it depends on what you want.  I wanted Quality (I've always loved the way Acura's drive and last), Safety (NHTSA and IIS best ratings --with suite of safety features), Visibility (you can actually see out of the car and over your shoulder), Dependability (not one issue with it for over a year),  and Ease of Driving (the smoothest engine and most maneuverability I've come across), ---(btw, the steering IS very connected to the road and incredibly sporty for a large sedan).  Not to mention--- the roomy, rear seat, , the quiet cabin, the improved suspension, the way it climbs a hill and never downshifts, not to mention its' classic, elegant appearance.  The RLX is a fantastic vehicle and it's a shame that it doesn't get more love in the press.  Read reviews from actual owners!!  Test drive it yourself, and you'll be extremely surprised in the best possible way.  Pricing is high, but check around to get a good deal.  They are out there.  There is nothing sedate about this top notch sedan.  It is thee hidden jewel at Acura!

Title: Great value car - great safety features standard
Review:  I was looking for a car that would provide some relief to a 52 mile round trip daily commute to work on very congested interstate (I-35 in Texas).  I wanted a car that had good performance, fuel economy, and semi-autonomous driving features.  I looked at BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, and Acura.  I choose the Acura RLX Hybrid because of Traffic Jam Assist, good fuel economy, and fantastic acceleration.  I have had the car two months and have put on over 3,000 miles in that time.  So far, I average 30 mpg.  Occasionally, I put the car in Sport mode, but I usually leave it in the standard drive mode.  In both modes, the car has very good acceleration; however, if you want the best acceleration put it in Sport mode.  I use Traffic Jam Assist daily.  It works best if you get in a freeway lane that does not have a lot of cars trying to merge in.  The system sometimes is slow to respond to a car that darts in front of you.  I have used the TJA to drive all the way from south Austin to north San Antonio and had to take control only once or twice.  I highly recommend this car.  I recommend that you ensure you are ok with the infotainment system and that you are fine with the small trunk before you buy.

Title: Liked the 2014 model and this is even better
Review:  Entertainment system may not be intuitive or showy but it works really well when you get used to it and the sound is awesome! Same for navigation - not showy but it does the job. The driving aids (lane keeping etc.) and ride are outstanding, and it is fast when you want it to be. Excellent value but I bought it because I liked it better than the Audi S5 I was considering. Great car for mid-west mixed driving. Way under-rated model.

Title: Luxury Sedan for everyday use!
Review:  I got this car back in April 2015. I have 9k miles on it now. Car drives without any issues whatsoever. When driving around 70 miles on the freeway car gets about 34mpg, even though by the book it is 31mpg. Mixed driving I get 26-27mpg, which is great considering how big car is. Car is definitely not the softest on the planet, since I saw few people complain about it, which is true I agree with that, however car is luxury/sport and some sport cars are not the most soft cars out-there. I really like a lot of standard options such as LED Headlights, P-AWS rear wheel steering technology 19" luxury wheels, acoustic windshield and front glass and etc., This car is definitely worth getting considering car cost a lot less than competition with similar options, less by about 15k. Also retail value always nice on Acuras and reliability is good if you think to keep car for longer than 5 years. In my opinion car looks much better than Lexus GS and boring looking Audi A6. Acura looks very beautiful, one of my favorite looking car in it's class.

Title: Great Car
Review:  Just to give a little backround, my last two cars were a Lexus GS and an Acura RL.  I did not like my Lexus at all and got rid of it after less than two years.  I had that Lexus in the shop 7 times in those two years for various problems.  Up until then, I had pretty much owned only Toyota or Lexus.  In 2008, I decided to get the Acura RL to replace the Lexus GS.  The Acura RL treated me very well for 6 years until I gave it to my daughter.  When it was time to get a new car, I considered many different luxury brands but kept coming back to Acura.  So far, I have 24,000 miles on the car.  I can honestly say, this is the best car I have ever owned.  I look forward to driving it everyday.  There were a couple of recalls which were easily taken care of...I was not having problems before the recalls.  If I had to do it again, I would not hesitate to get the RLX.  I would love to have the hybrid version but it was not available when I bought my car.  I had a deposit for one with the dealer but after waiting a year, they finally told me they weren't sure when they would available.  I guess that would be my one complaint with Acura...they had a predicted release date for the hybrid and it kept getting delayed and there was no information available as to if and when they were going to come out with the car.

Audio tapes have been sent to Acura Engineering and they are stumped.  I intend to get rid of it as soon as it comes back from shop (two weeks)   Bad news trade in value is now $35,000 for a one year old car with 12,000 miles for which I paid $52,000.

It has comfort, value, a killer stereo, reliability, and quality materials throughout.  Unfortunately, Acura has chosen not to aggressively market this model. That's too bad, because it's a real jewel!

Title: Forbes writer is an idiot. This car is awesome
Review:  First, any "Expert" that is paid to write an article about a car should have to drive one of the cars for a month, then write their opinion. This clown who was an independent writer for Forbes, says the 2016 Acura RLX is one of the worst 10 cars to buy. Seriously? A 5 Star safety rating in every category, phenomenal company (Acura makes a lemon?) incredibly smooth, quiet, has great acceleration, is sexy, sleek, but doesn't have the perception as a racecar like a BMW ( had one, and it sucked, unless you LIKE being in the repair shop all the time), so it gets hammered before it is even proven?  This Acura RLX is  so fun to drive, whether a short jaunt or a multiple hour trip, it is outstanding in spite of what a non-owner tries to tell you. Expect to but it $10K under MSRP. The technology package is nice, the visibility is great, and I'd rather have a DEPENDABLE, SAFE car like this than a slightly faster BMW that will break down, or Mercedes (Turbo charged 4 cylinders are stupid if you want a car long-term) sedan unless you buy 500. Acura has a reputation as dependable and reliable, and this is still true.

Title: outstanding car
Review:  We bought this car about a month ago and it was certainly the most expensive car we've ever purchased.  We did wind up test driving basically every car at the Acura dealership as well as checked out comprable Lexus sedans as well as the Accord (our historical default choice).  Now that we've driven the car for about 5 weeks, our intial impression: its fantastic!  I deliberately left the "value" category blank as its certainly in a very different class than other cars we've purchased in the past. (Frankly we'd consider that the Accord is a great "value".)   Thus far, we've been thrilled with the RLX Hybrid.  Its comfortable for long and short rides, quite sporty and, when driven a bit aggressively/sport mode, will certainly demand the driver's attention to keep the shiny side up.  The safety features are amazing (CMBS,LKAS, etc).  The safety features as well as the tech features did require some a bit of study, but now I find it very intuitive.  Overall an outstanig car!

Title: Electric Motors Accelerate Schmooooooth!!!!
Review:  Overall very satisfied with this purchase.  Currently at 14k miles.  No major glitches.  Controls are intuitive and easy to master.   However, Playing XM stations are glitchy and very slow to load, for scrolling;  as are obtaining music from your USB FlashDrive.  Push Button shifting, especially reverse, is slow to engage (1 sec) on press of accelerator.  Hybrid system is absolutely awesome, but comes with sacrifice of trunk space.  Engine is very quiet when switching between electric motors and engine running; transfers between each completely unnoticed except for the RPM needle moving, ......this hybrid is much different than those gas saving German models which "die" at a stop sign, then restart.  Very comfortable and rides well.  Power distribution lives up to the "rides on rails"  marketing motto.  Would definitely buy again, and recommend.

Title: No more acuras/hondas for me
Review:  I bought this car used only to have problems with it since the day i bought it. First when i got my first tire rotation the stud broke it wasn't a big deal then water kept getting into my tail light and the dealer said it had a bad seal. After that the struts went bad. Then finally around 40,000 miles the motor had a catastrophic failure. A rod bent causing two 3" holes in the block and basically they said it needed a new motor which would cost 10,000 dollars to install. And since the dealer could not find what caused it they said the warranty would not cover it. So i just simply let them have the car back bc i wasn't paying for a piece of junk car.

Title: This is no Honda Civic 
Review:  I was pleasantly surprised by the cars handling and performance.  It's a 5 speed Tiptronic automatic with a 2.0 L4 Vtec engine.  The car also handles great and easy to make lane changes.  Since the car is pretty light, it doesn't need a huge displacement engine to make it go fast, although a turbo would be nice aftermarket upgrade for those who had the type-s model.  I don't usually like 4 cylinder engines, but this one is quite a bit larger than most (Most are 1.6 L).  It's also quite a bit torquey for one as well (can get it to squeal on brisk acceleration).  The '05/'06 Models have the upgraded lighting and wheels which give it more of a luxurious look then previous years.

Vehicle: 2006 Acura RSX Hatchback 2dr Hatchback w/Leather (2.0L 4cyl 5A)
Title: An Acura, but not a luxury car.
Review:  Just bought an '06 RSX on a lease return.  Great condition and lots of fun to drive on my 8-mile commute on a bendy highway, but it lacks some pretty basic features like a remote hatch release.  I've owned Hondas exclusively since I turned 16 and each one, even my old '83 Accord SE, had a lever to pop the trunk from the driver's seat.  The plastic sun visors feel cheap, and there's not as much storage for odds and ends as I'd like.  Overall, I prefer the interior of my previous '98 Accord EX coupe for features but the leather seats offer great support and comfort in the turns.  Engine and performance in the RSX blow the Accord away.  Better mileage and acceleration? Well worth the price.

Title: Great Sports Car
Review:  This car is great, pretty fast for a 2.0L inline four. Quick on the acceleration and grabs corners like a magnet, rides smooth even over very deep pot holes and high speed bumps. At top speed is pretty smooth and stable along with shifting the whole way, pretty good for a 5M base but there's always aftermarket for those days when you wanna get up and go. Did lack a couple of interior options and design for an Acura but still being a sports car, it's awesome. I would recommend for any driver, guess thats why after I bought mine, I now know 5 people who recently bought one as well. Can't go wrong with a Honda.

Review:  I live in New York City and as an everyday commuter sitting in heavy traffic, the automatic makes perfect sense. It is a great looking car and very comfortable for 2 people. The handling is excellent and the sequential sportshift 5 speed is tons of fun. It is a little underpowered but that is why there is a Type-S. I upgraded to the 17 inch wheels from the type-s for better handling. The stock 16s lack style in my opinion.

Review:  Certainly a big step up from a '97 Explorer. Sporty feel in the suspension and more than enough power get off the line. Hardly any disappointments, except: no automatic headlamps, poor sound system, and sometimes the automatic doesn't respond after slowing below 20 mph. As for the lights, my explorer had them, so why not this? As for the sound system, there is no stock system that could ever compare to a decent after market system; and as for the throttle response, if it were a huge issue I would have gotten a manual transmission. As I said for the money, I don't think you could find a better car.

Title: Noisy & Cheap!  Never Again!
Review:  The Acura RSX is the most overrated car in America.  The car lacks any insulation resulting in road noise.  You need a powerful stereo just to avoid hearing the road noise.  That said, the stereo lacks any sounds quality.   The "leather" seats are partially vinyl which crack very easily.  The ignition lock is placed in the lowest part of the steering column.  As a result, my legs hit the keys. The design of the door windows is really solid... not.  When you roll up the windows, the side of the door moves.  In short, the car has poor insulation, flimsy door windows, illogical ignition lock design, faux leather, and a front windshield that rattles. I will never buy an Acura again. Cheap car!

It's been even better than I anticipated.  I considered the Honda Civic EX and the Scion but have been completely satisfied with my RSX.  It's fast, fun and completely comfortable to drive, gets excellent gas mileage and has all those standard features that make Acuras such a solid bargain.  Most of the online reviews mention that the RSX is not the fastest off the mark in first gear and that's true BUT it is more than fast enough!  The car's a blast to own and drive, it makes me happy every time I get behind the wheel.

Title: Great Car... except strut problem
Review:  The perfect blend of a daily driver and a back road driver with the ability to exhilerate.  This car can be driven as two different cars, below 4k rpm and above 4k rpm.  Take your pick and you won't be disappointed.  Be aware though that the RSX and from what I have learned the TSX have issues with the front struts.  The right front strut on my car began making noise at 500 miles, now at 7200 miles and no fix yet from the minds in Japan.  Other than a minor paint blemish this is the only fault I've found with the car.  Seats are great, providing a comfortable driving position, although extended drives become somewhat tiresome.  Auto headlamps would be nice.

Title: A Great All Around Choice
Review:  I decided it was time to purchase a reliable car that would hold its value, Acura was my choice. The warranties, customer service and quality of these cars are second to none.  I needed a daily driver that was sporty, reliable, held its value, and got great gas mileage at a good price. The RSX was all these things. I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I'm in Pa and averaging 31-32 mpg with a little spirited driving in that number.  The car gives all its power in the 5- 7k rpm range. It's quite a sound at that rpm. I wanted the S-Type but the insurance premiums made it unrealistic, not to mention having to use Premiums gas. The 5-speed base RSX was the perfect compromise for me.

Title: Spirited Driver
Review:  This review is from the perspective of a "spirited" driver that didn't have enough money for a ferrari. Yet.  Everything is as expected.  Honda's reliability with Acura's fit and finish yields an excellent platform.  The i-Vtec engine is really fun, even with only 155hp.  The lightweight chassis makes it seem like much more.  This car's fun-to-drive factor is through the roof, stable at high speeds, and very sure footed.  On frigidly cold mornings there is a little chatter from the dashboard (mounting clips?) but goes away after the car warms up.  Great in the snow.  Car never bottoms out.  I am disapointed about its gas mileage.  I wasnt expecting 34 but 25 is about the best I can expect.

Title: Road Noise
Review:  First off, the car is great, and everything you could ask for the money, HOWEVER, the road noise is horrible. The trunk and glove compartment rattle non-stop and the dashboard creaks when it is cold. I have taken it to the dealership 3 times and nothing has worked. I am thoroughly dissapointed in the overall quality. I was told that "its a commuter car and is noisy". If you don't mind the noise - buy it - if you do, run away fast.

Title: Like A Dream
Review:  This is my first car after owning a Chevy Cavilier and this car is fantastic.  I live in Miami and have to be in traffic alot but when I get a break in the road- it zips right out of those tight spots and gets ahead of alot of the other cars. I have been able to get out of traffic where a larger Mustang will get left behind. I don't see alot of RSX's around and when I do I think they look really hot on the road. My friends love my car and I have been challenged to race several times on the road- but of course, I am a safe driver. ;) Overall-  this car handles like a pro, it looks great and the chics love it. Black with tinted windows and all the fixings- it is the Intergra I always wanted.

Title: BEST ALL AROUND PURPOSE CROSSOVER SUV
Review:  I have never seen or driven a car like this before.  I've owned BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, Porsche 911, and Mercedes SL 55 and a Honda Pilot.  The SQ5  is a combination of all of them.  Its rides very comfortably, very stable, and quiet, sporty and with a lot of power and torque. Its a get up and go car, great to drive anywhere in the city or country.  I love the quality and the very advanced technology I feel like I'm in a spaceship.  I've tested the Volvo XC90, it had a very bouncy air suspension and I didn't quite trust their NAV system. I also test drove the RX 350, but again the ride was not as smooth and it just didn't absorb the bumps well, plus it was quite boring to drive. I've never test drove an Audi before until my wife wanted to look at the Audi Q7. After we bought the Q7, I just fell in love with it and had to have one just like it.  The SQ5 is a combination of sports car and comfortable SUV, very adaptable to all my different driving needs.

Title: Best luxury SUV w/ perfect comfort/sport balance
Review:  Very happy with choosing the 2018 Audi SQ5 prestige. Before buying, I compared it to the new F -Pace S, XC60 T8, 43 AMG, and upcoming redesigned  X3 M40i. With Audi SQ5's standard adaptive dampers, you get the best comfort, but also great sportiness when desired. The volvo is for my taste too soft and floaty, while the others are too harsh for a daily driver even with adaptive dampers. Even when driving back-to-back the Lexus RX and the SQ5 on my backroads, I found the SQ5 quieter and soaking up bumps much better than the Lexus RX while being faster at the same time. The virtual cockpit and the modern entertainment system are truly the best and most updated in their class, ahead of other competitors. Having google maps in a 12.3" screen in front of you w/ live traffic info is unbeatable. The XC 60 T8 comes close, but its infotainment system is rather laggy and ergonomics are not well though-out as everything, incl. heater, are adjusted w/ the main screen. So if that main screen does not boot up quickly or correctly you are basically left in the dark not being able to adjust anything. As confirmed by the recent reliability survey from consumer-reports, Audis are very reliable particularly compared to other luxury brands. Volvo and Jag are the bottom brands in this respect. All in all, it is the best grocery getter I have owned that pertains a dual-personality of keeping the rest of the family comfortable driving from A to B, but yet having the option of embracing windy and twisty roads with speed.

Title: Exceptionally balanced vehicle
Review:  Ive owned alot of cars since the late 70's, mostly BMW and Porsche. Ive owned 5 M3's, 2 M5's, 4 911's and more recently X5's, a Cayenne and even an X3M. Then I bought a 2012 Audi A8L and fell in love with the brand. Bought wife an Audi allroad and wanted something a little sportier. Wen to the dealer intending to look at the S4/S6/7 line and was considering the S5 sportback. All of the aforementioned is only for context. Im an older guy who appreciates performance and yet I have a perspective of how much performance a person can actually use on the street. I also enjoy a modicum of practicality and so many new cars today offer both that could only be dreamed of 10 or 15 years ago. The SQ5 is without a doubt the best balance of both comfort and performance I have encountered to date in an easy to live with package. Simply amazing the choices we consumers enjoy today. I considered a Macan but the usual Porsche buying experience is a turnoff. Additionally, my local Audi dealer was terrific to deal with and frankly, the SQ5 technology embarrases the Macan as well as the driving dynamics of the 2018 SQ5 feel far superior to the older platform that underpins the Macan. You can't go wrong with the SQ5 and be sure to get the virtual cockpit option.

Title: A rare find!
Review:  I have owned a 2006 BMW X5, 4.4V8, 2009 Mercedes ML350, 3.5V6, and now this supercharged German beast! I have driven over 4000 mi. in about 6 weeks mainly urban commuting. The SQ5 by far has outshined my previous makes and models in almost every aspects, from interior quality, to performance, agility, steering precision, and nimbleness in maneuvering. I truly enjoy this new found, near instant acceleration, very useful in overtaking slow-pokes on Houston freeways, and ingressing from ramps to freeways. Also the braking is quite impressive too with its massive front rotors and pads.  Interior fit and finish oozes quality, and attention to detail, from knurled knobs to beautifully contoured dash and center console, and a smooth metal and leather round gearshift knob. All controls are quite logical. However adjusting the fan speed is a two step process, and speaker volume control not in its usual location. Lack of USB port makes up by having WIFI & media bluetooth connection, and two SD card slots. I just copied my entire music collection on one SD slot, all at my fingertips. Though the front seats are beautifully made, they are narrow for the north american ass. I am just over 200lbs, but wish the seats were a bit wider for drives longer than an hour. The view out the front, sides, and up is great, except for the massive blindspots from the two side view mirrors. Not exactly "Mickey Mouse ears" mirrors, they still block your view of the curb you are turning into. Very careful, not to hit the curb with those awesome 21" wheels. I truly enjoy driving the SQ5, every chance I get. It sure feels like a refreshing change from  the Merc, and the BMW, which seem to have become such mainstream, with the soccer moms. The styling, lines, curves are mild, understated, unlike the crazy and faddish Japanese exterior designs lately. I am hoping the SQ5 will be as durable as well it performs.

Title: What a Cayenne Turbo driver thinks of this car
Review:  This will surprise you. Forget the BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. The only real competitor to the SQ5 is the Macan S. If you've had fun in your previous car, expect twice as much in the SQ5. The supercharged engine is far superior to any turbo. The power is instant and gratifying, complemented with the best engine tune in class. The transmission is composed and civilized in traffic and fast during spirited driving. The SQ5 beats its competitors hands down on gratification. If you like a softer ride, go with the 20" wheels on the SQ5 or a Macan with air suspension. The X3 and GLC suspension can also be dialed down into comfort but those two will never escape their mommy wagon stigma. The other area where the SQ5 outshines all its competitors is practicality: much more interior space than the Macan, much bigger windows than the Merc and BMW, much better sound insulation (laminated windows standard) and much better access through rear doors than the Macan. The flat-bottom steering wheel is great for getting in and out, especially for bigger people. The SQ5 is not perfect: its only USB port is located in the passenger glove box and its adaptive cruise control does not go all the way to stop. But it stands for Stealth Wealth - people who want to drive the best without spilling the beans. I still can't believe the sleeper status of this car. If you can find one, get one with optional diamond stitching inside! This car looks best in Daytona Gray and Sepang Blue.

Title: What a dissapointment
Review:  If interested, you may want to read my reviews on the 2002 Audi S8 (massive engine failure despite excellent service history), 2014 Q5 TDI (Expensive Vibrator).  I also have a 2008 S5 Coupe (so far, so good but it's going soon).  So, this review is not in a vacuum, but with some real Audi ownership experience.  OK, cut to the chase - in Florida Lemon Law circus at present.  It was disappointing with delivery of the car.  The interior is made as cheaply as possible and it shows.  This is not the el cheapo standard seating.  Buzzers going off, alarms going off all the time.  Sport Utility Vehicle.  Well, utility is a joke.  Doors lock when you don't want them to, alarms and warnings going off.  Between Health & Safety and the accountants, the car is pathetic.  Can't even turn the radio off without shutting off the Navigation.   These are but annoyances really.  The real joy began on a long road trip, right after the 5,000 mile service.  About 300 miles into the trip the add oil light came on.  Pulled off into a service station and could not find the oil dip stick.  Called the dealer (Reeves of Tampa, of whom I've been dealing with with the other Audi's and Porsche and think highly of) and informed that they don't have dip sticks.  Well, the upshot of the trip was that I would add maybe 1/3 of a quart every 500 miles.  The day I got home I brought it in and they had it for about a week, said it was fixed and within 110 miles it was telling me to add oil again.  They then had it for two weeks (Total 15 days for Lemon Law) and again the light came on.  Now the purpose of the car is my commute to work, from Tampa, FL to outside New Orleans, LA.  I can't be late looking for Audi dealers to see if I really need oil or not.  So, I then started the Lemon Law process.  Audi had 10 days to respond, but took 14 days.  I took the car back to Reeve for the final repair attempt.  They are allowed 10 days, but took 15 days.  I was told it was fixed, but the lights are on again.  The Better Business Bureau that one must go through stated today that Audi considers the car fixed.  Funny, I just took it to the dealer again today to have them manually check the oil before my next road trip.I'm totally disgusted with Audi Engineering (which seems to be run by accounting these days) and their customer support.  I have not ever had anyone from Audi give a courtesy call and sincerely state that they are sorry for my situation.  Rather, they just basically ignore the timelines set forth by the State of Florida.  Now whether that is due to arrogance, incompetence or being understaffed (due to more accountant management) I can't say, but it is not very impressive what ever the case is.  I requested that this be resolved by 23 December as I have to travel for business again, but that request was not acknowledged."Truth in Engineering"???  maybe they should revise to "Truth is, it's Value Engineering".  Just a suggestion....Update.  While waiting for the arbitration hearing I took it in for the 15,000 mile service with the agreement that there would be no tampering or repair attempts.  After the service the yellow oil idiot light does not come on.  Fixed, well, not exactly.  I took it to another mechanic, had him drain about 2 qts of oil out and that yellow oil light still won't come on, and the computer screen is now different.  Hmmm, change the oil and these things magically change as well.  I'm letting the Federal Trade Commission & FL Attorney General's Office figure that out.  The complaint is under Unfair & Deceptive Business Practices. Finally had the Florida Arbitration Hearing, they ruled in my favor (3-0) but the law is so lame that the settlement was not acceptable to me.  Again attempted to settle this with Audi & Reeves Tampa Audi to no avail.  Now waiting for a court date under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.  Nearly one year sense the problem started.**Update**  One week prior to the pre trial hearing we went to mediation.  Volkswagen decided after a very brief negotiation to give me essentially what I had been asking for for over a year and pay my attorney's fees as well, and of course that the poorly engineered and overpriced piece of junk (my opinion) back.  I am actually getting rid of my other Audi, an S5 coupe this week.  I want nothing to do with Volkswagen or the local dealership (Reeves Audi of Tampa) in the future due to the way I've been treated.  I have been a gentleman through this entire process, but was bullied, lied to and had the dealership play games which have been reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Florida Attorney General's office for unfair & deceptive business practices.  Used that dealership for 15 years with Porsche & Audi.  No more!Just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing more to add, other than I can't imagine myself ever purchasing another product under VW.Again, I just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing to edit

Title: SQ5 Great Drive But
Review:  The 2015 SQ5 has a great drive!  But the MMI system is the pits.  Too many buttons, levers, dials, etc. to search for and too many actions with them before what you want to happen does happen and too much time looking away from the road while searching for what you want.  But it is fun to drive, good size, fairly comfortable, too expensive, visibility not the best, and, considering cost,  behind somewhat in technology.

Review:  Purchased my very first Audi in May 2016...new SQ5!  Had been shopping around for Audi Q3 and also Porsche Macan S.  Test drove the SQ5 one day and new this was the Audi for me.  The performance for a mid-size CUV is impressive.  Great acceleration and stopping power for a performance vehicle.  The quality of craftsmanship/materials is outstanding.  Love the interior design and seats...very comfortable and have great support. The carbon-fiber trim and matte chrome trim in the dash and doors add a very nice and elegant touch.  Love the Google maps feature and wifi hotspot feature.  The Bang and Oulfsen sound system is first rate in a vehicle in this price category.  While many have complained of no USB ports, this can be easily remedied by the USB plug adapter which so far has worked just fine.  Overall I'm very impressed and pleased with the Audi SQ5.  I smile every time I get behind the wheel.  I'm definitely an Audi fan!

Review:  First of all Edmunds price promise was great.All dealers gave different discounts so we just picked the best one that had the SQ5 with all the options we wanted. Only had the car 2 weeks but just completed a trip to Canada and it is just a pleasure to drive. I've had other sports cars before and we just traded a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee for the Audi. No Comparison. Besides the original price the Audi is in another league. Hopefully I'll be saying the same in a few years.

Review:  Legacy of many sports cars here with a small collection, but first sport SUV.  Traded a 2013 335i sport line which was an amazing car.   Acceleration is less in SQ5 than the Bimmer, but everything else is extremely comparable.   Handling tightly the curvy NC mountain roads, crushing light to light performance on the straight roads of Florida, limo like feel for the date nights with my wife, and of course Quattro safety.   Cannot say enough great things.   My wife is a hard sell on my sports car addiction, but this car  is now her daily driver passing by our corvettes, BMW M4, and others including a Hummer that she calls "too slow" (and it is).  Accolades to Audi.   We keep coming back, and have had A6 4.2, S4 Cabrio, but this is our best Audi yet.

Title: What a sleeper of a CUV! This vehicle scoots!
Review:  I love my SQ5!I really thought I wanted the Porsche Macan S, which similarly configured would have cost me about $2 grand more. It had a better interior, certainly more head turning appeal and better steering. The practical side of me thought the Audi will net fewer tickets if for no other reason than the police wouldn’t get as big of a thrill writing a ticket on an Audi. Besides, this is my daily driver and bottom line was the best “practical” choice of the two.Now the pros/cons: The good – Wow! What a fun driving experience! It sits up high and accelerates like an S4/S6, even besting the hp output. I can’t say enough about how much fun this vehicle is to drive! It stops quickly and has a solid feeling stance as it hugs the road. The WiFi and Google maps round out a very nice technology package (I will always want Google Maps from here on in every vehicle). So the bad: no USB ports (really!?!) and a small 7.5” screen in a car today seems tiny. Rounding out my dislikes is storage space is not great and the steering, although tight is not what I would expect from a German-made premium vehicle.The overall sporty drive, understated classy looks, ride comfort and technology make this one of my favorite cars to own. I look for reasons to run out for something just to drive it!Lastly, golf clubs will fit fore to aft if you slide the rear seats forward a couple inches.

Review:  I see great reviews here for this vehicle and I'd add my name to the list of praise. Great vehicle. Fast. Well-made. Roomy. In fact the only complaint I have is how 'worthless' the car was after I'd driven it 50K plus. The disastrous resale was shockingly terrible. It makes you look at the SQ5 in a whole new light. Brutal. Worse than you'd expect. Did I say terrible? But owning this vehicle has been flawless. It delivered everything I expected. I wished the ride wasn't so hard and seats so unforgiving. But that's the tight ride quality sacrifice, it is a wickedly fast beast and can handle itself easily with all that going on. With room for whole family and much more. A really expensive reality of owning this car is the tires. 2K per 25-30K mi. Kinda eye-opening. Strangely, the MPG never bothered me, it was very good for a beast like this. Final opinion: a bummer of toxic-level bad resale value and operating costs-- yet a brilliant, awesome vehicle.

Review:  Purchased leave return. I loved the way it looked, made heads turn, the power, and fuel mileage.  Bought certified lease return because they come with a 100,000 mile warranty.  Made me feel safe.  The car started using a lot of oil. Audi refills for free. The car started using 1/2 every 1000 miles.  I was told normal. It still ran like scalded dag.  I finally complained enough at the dealership that they "marked" my engine and did an oil consumption test at 78,000 miles.  The engine was shot.  It needed new pistons and rings.  Worse news oil consumption is NOT covered by Audi's extended warranty.  I also learned the 2.0 turbo aluminum block does NOT have steel sleeves.  I wont even discuss the rotor issue, sun roof failure, oil separator failure......etc.

Title: My Audi CarPlay
Review:  Out of all the car in the world, I chose this one.  Sure I also wanted 35 mpg.  But it get a true 28.1 on my first highway drive.  And the comfort factor along with the B&0 speaker system.  (Sweet).  No problems so far.  But I'm deciding on an extended warranty to address any expensive problems.  I love this car...

Title: Loved my car until it died
Review:  I bought my Audi Q5 new in 2012 after owning a VW Passat wagon which handled like a dream, but couldn't handle upstate NY pot holes. I maintained my Audi religiously through the dealership, all recalls were done when notified. At 80,000, (2010?)suddenly I had to start adding oil b4 the next oil change service. I questioned the dealership and was told that was to be expected because of the age of the vehicle & to keep adding oil. This continued for 2 1/2 years, and being continually reassured by the dealership. The oil light was coming on more frequently, I kept adding more oil. 2 months ago I went to a different dealership-(the original dealer is no longer dealing in Audi). They told me my pistons were bad, something had been manufactured incorrectly and there had been an issue that Audi knew of. To rectify the problem would cost me $6000. - again the dealer told me to just keep adding oil.  I checked into it on the internet- class action suit years 2008-2011. My car is an early 2012-manufacturered 02/12. Contacted Audi told me to pay 4 an oil compression test, which didn't happened in time. My car is currently sitting in my driveway,@ 109,000 miles, undriveable and awaiting a tow truck because it suddenly does no more than 23 miles an hour.  Audi's not sure what my out come will be!? AND that I should prepared myself for the outcome.  WOW talk about stabbing loyal owners in the back. Get a Mercedes, BMW or Volvo.

Title: Q5 Audi--Very overrated and Un-reliable
Review:  I purchased this Audi Q5 from the original owner with 23000 on it. The brake rotors and pads were replaced at 19000 miles. I should have questioned this service at such low mileage--big mistake. I take excellent care of a car and drive it in a very sensible manner. It needed brakes again at 35000 miles, including rotor replacement.  At 38500 it had to have major engine repair--too much carbon build in the engine. It was over three years old, so the warranty was gone.  Big $$$ to repair. Fuel injectors needed replacement at 42000 miles. In summary, I would describe this high dollar car as poor quality, unreliable, very expensive to maintain and very overrated. The local Audi dealer is good, but with labor rates at $135.00 per Hr. well it just is not worth it. I would not recommend an Audi nor will I purchase one in the future

Title: Great Little SUV
Review:  I bought my 2012 Q5 brand new.  I chose the 3.2 engine because when I test drove the 2.0, I couldn't stand the way the turbo charger whined every time the car shifted. I love the way it hugs the road. I have driven in snow and ice without chains or studded tires and never had a problem. The back seats are not that comfortable for long trips though. It really should be considered a four seater unless the center seat in the back is occupied by a car seat.  The biggest complaint I have about this vehicle are the oversized side view mirrors. I have to make a point of looking all around them. A couple of times I could not see the people in the crosswalk because the driver side mirror was blocking them completely. I once cut off a motorcycle because he was behind the passenger side mirror. I need to look into after-market smaller side mirrors. The cargo room with the rear seats in the upright position could be a little larger. Great turning radius. Handles really well. Best car for teenager to learn to drive. Quiet. Working the navigation system is confusing.  Not a great paint job. My dog's nails left a deep scratch in the bumper while he was getting into the cargo area.

Title: 2012 AUDI Q5 - IT'S A LEMON!
Review:  I bought this car new in 2012. Four years later the engine died, and the dealership wanted to charge me $6,100 to essentially replace the entire top half of the engine, due to a timing chain defect, and they refused to pay anything toward it. Absolutely unacceptable for a car that's basically new, with only approximately 75,000 miles on it. I made sure that I took it for an oil change every 3,000 miles and regularly scheduled service. If you are planning on purchasing an Audi Q5, DON'T DO IT! Do your online research (timing chain/transmission/etc.) and you'll see how poorly made these vehicles are.

Title: Very Sporty, great quality but
Review:  This 2012 car (Premium) was not even on my radar as I wanted another sporty SUV but they did not have the color and specs I wanted. So my husband and I came across the Audi Q5 and was like no way because of the name, maintenance costs associated and the funky controls but when we test drove it plus the low mileage (off of a lease), I fell in love.  I think my husband more so.  It was sporty, luxurious (black w/brown leather interior), not too big.  I was not crazy about getting a 4cyl coming from a Lexus RX300 6cyl because I like a little pedal power but the sport mode seemed to have enough get up and go.  Now that I have had the car almost 9 months I can adequately give an informed review on my first Audi, albeit used and extensive.  PROS:   It is definitely a sporty, luxurious SUV, love the look of the interior and exterior especially the inside lights at night; nice sound system, great gas mileage, roomy trunk, roof etc.  Interior quality is nice and for a 4cyl it has nice power in turbo/sport mode.  CONS:  I felt like I needed a Ph.D. in Audi.  It is not intuitive, e.g. sunroof.  Like other reviewers, the multimedia system can be confusing and is disappointing especially the location because although I use the wheel controls I still find myself looking down and that is dangerous.  I feel like I'm controlling an aircraft or an ultrasound machine with the rotary dial, push, turn, push turn dial; some of my FM stations don't always come in unless I hit my presets.  My 20 yr old son and I cannot believe I have to buy several adapters in order to listen to  music on our iphones.  Other cars have easier bluetooth hookups than this car.   Putting the adapter in the glove box was just idiotic. Radio text should be automatic.  The Navigation is old and useless because Audi wants you to buy a cd for updated maps...not.  Let's not even talk about the brake dust every two seconds.  The backseat is a little tight but even tighter for 3 people as the hump takes up leg room.  I am coming up on 30k and the maintenance schedule says to change spark plugs at 35k???  Really?  Spark plugs should last 75k-100k!?  Overall I love the look and feel of the Q5 but I paid for the name and look.  The maintenance costs are too high at Audi.  Although I did my research which had many good reviews, but at this price ($35k), I do not think I would ever buy a used 4cyl again (despite turbo) at this price point with so many issues or lack of certain things as stated above. I will keep this car for a few more years and probably give it to my son and hope it lasts 10-15 years like my Lexus but will go back to a 6cyl SUV that is sporty with easier "touch" controls and less issues.

Title: Car of my dreams turns out to be a dud!
Review:  I've wanted this car for 4 years. I finally purchased one after test driving all other vehicles in its class just to be sure. Only 35k miles when I purchased and was a lease return (keep in mind I made sure they put new rotors and break pads on the vehicle when I purchased it). I have owned this car less than one year and put 20k miles on it. I had completed the 45k mile service no problem. Just took it in for the 55k service and was told it needed new brake pads and rotors along with brake fluid flush, oil pressure valve replacement and of course that's on top of the $399 price tag for the 'normal' maintenance at 55k miles. All of that totalling $2,300!! And I haven't even owned the vehicle for a year. I knew that audi's were expensive to fix but did not realize the poor quality of the factory parts such as brake pads and rotors. I'm not a crazy driver and take pride in driving my car gently only occasionally speeding and braking when needed. On a side note the blue tooth is horrible and the navigation is useless. After this experience I have lost faith in Audi. I definitely will not be purchasing one again. I do not feel that this car is worth the price tag...disappointing altogether.

Title: It Makes Me Smile
Review:  I have shopped for an SUV for three years, awaiting the Jeep Cherokee, then opting for the AWD Nissan Rogue. When I couldn't get the color and version I wanted on time, I found a 2012 Q5 very lightly used for the same price as these new cars...only12k miles.  Today I took it on the infamous run to costco and found myself smiling...when the back gate opens automatically, when I stashed the wine bottles in the compartment under the rug, when I got in and turned on the Bang & Olufsen upgraded sound, and when the turbo kicked in and I shot past another car uphill.   The build quality is excellent and this 3 yr old feels tight and solid. After my last Nissan Murano, it feels like a sports car

Review:  Audi service is horrible.I bought new a Q7 TDI and a Q5 for my wife.First the Audi dealer overfills the oil in the Q7 causing all kinds of problems and would not fix them because the car was just out of warranty.Then my coolant in the Q5 starts leaking all over the garage and they say it wonÂt be fixed under warranty because the leak could be caused from an Âoutside influenceÂ.I called Audi America who says ÂsorryÂ nothing we can doÂ.I am going to relay my terrible experience on every blog I can find.Such a shame as I really loved the Q7 and thought I could get more than 70k miles out of it.FYI- Criswell in Annapolis was the dealer.

Title: Lovely vehicle but far too many issues for the price
Review:  We've owned a Premium Plus (3.2) Q5 for around four months and have driven it extensively in city and on highway.It's a fine vehicle, very comfortable, and has plenty of power.However, there are many small issues with the car that really boggle the mind at the $50k-ish price.1. The multimedia system is, frankly, awful. It's design that feels a decade old, the control dial scrolls things the opposite way from other consumer devices (eg iPod), and the menu system is convoluted.2. The GPS is completely useless. The maps provided with the car are at least 4-5 years old and the routing is poor.3. The gas cap cover has broken already, 4 months in. Flimsy construction.

Also, rear door does not stop quickly enough and for small objects in it's line of descent to a closed position.My son who is only 9 had it push down on him.If you can't get bags, body parts or dog paws out of the way in time, it could dangerous.

And, so far good gas mileage, about as advertised, but much better than our Acura. The tech'y stuff takes a little getting used to, Nav, Bluetooth, media, and personal/car settings.

Title: OK with Reservations
Review:  We picked this car as a CPO from a BMW dealer.  No problems to date.  Relatively decent handling for the type car, and just the right size and height.  We stayed away from the newer version to avoid a Mini based front wheel platform derived car as opposed to a BMW based one.  The new 2018 X1 also features a flimsy cloth covering under the moonroof that I can see ripping quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         If you want a X1 like this may I suggest springing for the upgraded interior.  Base level seating has poor lateral support and are unacceptable.  Base halogen headlights are unacceptable and should be avoided.  My 3 series coupe has xenons which are "light years" better.  Sorry!:-)  Base sound system is "media-ocre" at best.  I don't understand the need for moonroofs on BMWs, and wish they would apportion the monies elsewhere and delete them.  Acceleration with the 240 hp is considerably better than you would expect for a 4 cyl.  It feels like a 6!  Braking is only adequate , but some experts blame this on the stock tires rather than the car.  I also would like a manual transmission X1 like they have in other countries!  When you're shopping, seek out a well optioned example only!  A base car sporting only a badge is bad form indeed.

Title: Worst Purchase I've ever made
Review:  1.	Dealership was a joke to work with, lied on two separate occasions about frivolous things.2.	Electronics keep tripping – Dealership has no idea. It’s not logging. 3.	O2 Sensor light comes on every time I go down my parking garage and stays on for the remainder of the trip. Dealership has no idea what to do. 4.	Key fob lasted 2 years. 300 Bucks+ for a new one, excluding programming costs. 5.	Gas mileage nowhere near estimated. A daily commuter who uses the interstate. I’m not heavy on the gas, I estimate 20.5 mpg with 91-octane.6.	Brand new $39,000. For a 2014 BMW X1, NADA Resale max shows $19,500. At best I lost $19,500 in three years.7.	I will never own another BMW.  I’ll stick with Lexus and Acura.

Title: Great handling vehicle with in need of improvement
Review:  Purchased 2014 X1 fully loaded with M-Sport package. Great handling car with aggressive sporty ride, coming from a V6 engine it was hard to believe this car was only equipped with turbo 4. Comes with just enough tech to be comfortable (I never cared for Lane Departure Assistance, Front Collision Warning, and other new safety features). It however came with the crappiest quality materials I have seen in German cars, and it because the hard plastics were constantly expanding and rubbing, rattles/creaks were always present. The run flats combined with M suspension did not help either. Oh, and I purchased this vehicle at 45k and 2 years later the value was at 14k so its two year depreciation was @ 68% which is a little steep even for a BMW.

Title: Tak ada fun right out of my BMW
Review:  My first BMW and I'm now caught in the Takata airbag mess. BMW felt it was safe enough for me to drive but not take in trade, "they also have a stop sale on any affected models". I contacted BMW and asked for and got a rental car. The dealer now has my BMW and at this point I have doubts about if and when I will ever see it again and I'm sure I will take a beating when I trade or sell it if and when I do.  Do yourself a favor go to safercar.gov and check the vehicle ID number of ANY CAR you have or are looking to buy to check for open recalls!  Avoid any car with a TAKADA airbag open recall like the plague. On the bright side I have a rental 2016 VW Jetta 1.4 that is almost as peppy as my BMW, has a better quieter ride is way more roomy and it is getting between 36-38 MPG. (The BMW only got 23 MPG average) I could almost buy three VW's for what I paid for my X1 BMW . NEVER AGAIN LESSON LEARNED.. Foot Note: Several manufacturers are still making cars with these deadly inflators buyer beware!!!!!UPDATE Traded in 2016 for a new RAV 4 Hi-Bred the Rav rides better, burns regular gas, gets outstanding mileage, and the resale will be higher. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BMW lesson learned.

Title: Bought pre-owned, driven for 2yrs and 30,000 miles
Review:  This is a great lil X1 and at a great price point for a 2014 used BMW.  I downsized from my 2005 X5 which I loved and miss very much (had 160k miles and never a major repair or problem).  I've always been happy with BMW's.  I've owned 7, 5, 3 and X series throughout the last 20 or so years.  The reason I down sized is because I'm a commuter and was looking for something that can give me 30mpg on the hwy.  It was the BMW or Subaru.  I've also enjoyed Subaru's and nowadays these are my only two choices of go to vehicles for cars as a daily driver.  I'm a car enthusiast and have owned Ferrari, Mercedes, Lexus and plenty other luxury and sports cars.  I'm not posting to brag I'm posting so the reader knows I have choices and know about many cars from first hand driving experience.  This X1 is great in handling around town.  I got this due to it's looks, compact size for ease of downtown parking, cargo area for placing travel bags, groceries and 60/40 split that I can slide in my surfboard.  The only reason I didn't choose the Subaru is I really don't visit the snow that much.  But if you get the X1 in the xDrive it'll be a very close match.  I got the sDrive because it feels more like driving a sports car with that real wheel power and cutting in tight corners when I punch it around the twisties and I like that feeling.  Go for the Ultimate Package as it'll include many features like Navigation, Rear Camera and Parking Distance Control.What I miss is having that extra space or elbow room when I have passengers and sitting much higher up (comparing with my old X5).  What I love better is the newer electronics and fuel efficiency and having the Ultimate Package amenities. If you're looking into a used X1 then go with 2014 or 2015 model years.  2013 was the first year this model hit the US and the 2016 has been completely redesigned in and out.  The deals are on the 2014 for all the lease returns that hit and chances are you'll still get the 4 year/50k miles free maintenance plan that's remaining and Certified Pre-Owned near bumper to bumper warranty if you buy it from a BMW dealer.  All the BMW dealerships I checked out actually had better deals compared to other car lots.

Title: Should NOT have the BMW badge
Review:  I have the 2014 xDrive28i model.  The seats are cheap and not comfortable for a long drive.  The acceleration is more like a Ford Escort than a BMW.  The sales guy said it is because it is a 4 cylinder.  No excuse.  The BMW engineers should be ashamed of what they created.  The navigation is ok, but feels more like my 2004 Infiniti G35 than a 2014.  The steering and suspension are stiff.  This is good for me.  It's very loud on the road.  You hear everything.  The tires wear down very quickly.  The dealer was telling me to replace them at around 13,000 miles.  Ridiculous.  Anyone, besides my kids, who gets into the car has a little trouble, no matter how I position the passenger seat. I've taken the car to the dealer a dozen times over the past 2 years for different problems (wiper blades not contacting windshield, bluetooth wouldn't connect, valve cover leaking oil onto intake manifold, and the list goes on).  Thankfully, I only have one year left on my lease.  It kills me to have to drive this car for that long, but it's the commitment/mistake I made.  I feel like I got taken by the BMW logo.  Won't happen again.

Review:  I have owned five BMW's now including a 2001 3 series convertible, a 2003 3 series, a 2009 Z4 and now the X1.  I intentionally dropped down in size and class of car, so I went in expecting some compromises..but not what I have gotten.  Horribly cramped, the auto engine cut off is terrible, average gas mileage is 7-8 mpg worse than the lowest rating, interior is flimsy and several plastic pieces fall out of their place regularly and worst of all, my side airbags went of with no collision at all as I was taking a corner (BMW dealer has told me this isn't the first time they have dealt with this!)  Add to this the fact that the seats are horribly uncomfortable and I am beyond disappointed.

I wanted something small and simple for work, baseball coaching, skiing, winter/summer.  I looked at Subaru Outback.  The outback was $13K less based on MSRP but the X1 leased for $150 less per ($330 per month with nothing down but an old Escape with 130K miles).  The little engine is just amazing even comparing to all the big BMW V8s.  I dont need more than 240 hp.  When BMW beats subaru on price+features, I'd call that value!

Title: Just got one.
Review:  I can't say much about it, I got it for wife who said she wanted a hatchback with pep.  These criteria took me to the VW GTI, a very highly rated and affordable car.  We test drove one of those, and wife found it too low, and plain looking.  She somehow decided it was a "kid car". I was frustrated and so surfed to the X1. Wife loved it's classy look (the BMW emblem on it didn't hurt anything), it's higher stance, and was very happy driving it.  It's amazingly affordable. Her's has the moonroof and the nice rain-sensing wipers. Most other features are standard. We picked out one of 3 white ones on the lot, I would have liked the premium audio and upgraded rearview with compass

First off when I drove the brakes had to be replaced with less than 1000 miles.The On/Off functionality is stupid.When you park the car it shuts off except for the accessories and you have to turn it on and then off again which causes wear and tear per the manual.And after 4 months apparently there was liquid spilled on the iDrive which caused it to be replaced for the cost of $650.Unbelievable design to put an electronic iDrive between 2 cup holders that can't withstand condensation from a cup.Cheap interior as well.Never Again!

Title: A BMW from the good old days of BMW design
Review:  I bought this X1 because it's a dying breed of BMW from times before BMW went soft, heavy, and lost their steering mojo. It has the chassis and handling dynamics from the previous generation E90/E91 platform that's one of the best handling 3 series. It has hydraulic steering instead of BMW's new vague, imprecise electric steering. Those are combined with the most recent, excellent drive train. Add the comparatively low price and this BMW is unique. It will be replaced in the 2016 model year by a front-wheel drive platform shared with the Mini Cooper. Yuck.

But for now I am very biased and I like this car. I like driving and this one just pure joy. However my old 325i could turn sharper (X1 center of gravity is higher). Also turbo does not respond as fast as my previous car's 6cil from dead stop. There is a short delay and then turbo delivers massive torque and then traction control has to work hard ;)On the hiway its pure joy, power is always there when you need it. At 400 mi I got 26+ mpg, no eco-pro

Has the same confident, lane-holding feel when you are zipping down the far left lane on the highway like you feel in an X5.Lots of room in the front, though not much for storage.There are only 2 safety belts in the rear though there is room for a 3rd person in the middle.Because of the 40/20/40 split, there is a lot of storage flexibility.The fuel economy is nice too.I bought mine as a service loaner w 4K miles and WHAT A VALUE at around $31K.I am as satisfied with this vehicle as with any vehicle previously owned.

I test drove and researched similiar models for over a month and it came down to the X1 and Q3 Audi. In the end, the dealership made us a fantastic offer, and were just more attentive to us as the customer.

Title: Exactly what I was looking for
Review:  My commute used to be 4 miles, so I bought a cute little Mercedes coupe.  Then my commute changed and was taking 2 busy highways for 45 minutes.  I felt very insecure in my little car.  I really like driving a car, so although I wanted a higher vehicle, I didn't look forward to the parking issues of having a bigger vehicle.  Then I came across the X1.  It is actually 6" shorter than my coupe was and not much wider.  However, it has the height I wanted, and great interior and cargo space!  Just blown away!  When I test drove it, I immediately felt comfortable with the location of all the controls.  I am only 5'4" and everything is easily reached.  I've always really liked the controls to be in the gear shift area and using a dial.  Someone commented it isn't safe to look down.  You aren't supposed to look at it at all.  That is the point of it being down there, so you can adjust things by touch instead of by sight.  You just need to learn where the buttons are and how to use the dial effectively.  The visibility is great and since I don't have any depth perception, I LOVE the parking help.  Now I can go around tight spaces without worrying about hitting something.  There are 2 negatives only, the rear window is small and blocked by the rear center head rest.  I'll just fold down the center to improve viewing.  Also, the seat is very firm.  I'll have to bring a seat pad for long trips.  For a daily driver with lots of stop and go traffic, I am ecstatic.  It is great looking and fun to drive.  ***update after driving for a month.  The seat has softened from use, so now it is quite comfortable.

The handling, acceleration and seats are all fantastic. The other car companies must pay people to write bad reviews. Please at least go and test drive one and you will be amazed. The lighting at night is really neat. Also, BMW rebuilds their cars on the inside, not some new plastic molding like other car companies. Get it! Enjoy it! I just wanted to let people know.

Title: Best small SUV currently available
Review:  Every car is a series of compromises.  In the areas that are priorities to me - safety, quality, performance - the X1 scores well.  Its chief limitations are modest cargo capacity and a somewhat cramped (for adults at least) rear seat.  However, given that the X1 has a footprint barely bigger than a Prius, it is roomy by the standards of small vehicles.  If you need substantial cargo capacity you should look at the X3 or X5.  If you need to seat adults in the rear seats on a regular basis look at the X3 or ensure that you get an X1 with the sliding/reclining rear seat option.  But for my family only small children sit in the back, and the standard X1 is just about ideal.  We have a second car which is a good deal larger than the X1.  Parking tends to be difficult where we live, and it is significantly easier to find a parking place for the X1 than it is to find a parking place for the larger vehicle.  Fuel economy is noteworthy, I did not believe the stated 32mpg on the highway was really achievable, but we took a road trip with the X1 and I can report that figure is absolutely attainable.  Overall great small SUV.

Title: Significant improvement from the prev. generation!
Review:  I had a 2014 X1 (prev generation) that was my favorite car ever, but was coming off lease. I expected this new generation of X1 to be fair since it was being molded to look like the rest of the X-line family (truth be told, I wanted the Tesla Model 3 but couldn't wait that long). I was wrong. Dead wrong. This is actually more fun than the last one. Slightly less horsepower, yet the 0-60 is quicker. The move to a front-wheel-emphasized 4WD is not noticeable. I sometimes miss the hydraulic steering (however, the 2016's adaptive steering makes parking and city driving much easier). I got every tech package except the ACC (c'mon, an extra thousand, really?) and it seems worth it. By adding a few extra PSI to the tires (compared to the door sticker), I am getting 35+ MPG on the highway! Eco-mode is much more useful now without sacrifice (I especially didn't like the jolt on the 2014 when I needed to pass someone on the highway due to the shift timing change in this mode). The interior materials are a step up (interior lighting at night is especially top notch). The rear view is crowded compared to previous gen (due to smaller rear window and seat back obstructions), but not dangerous. The front seats are narrower than the last model and could use a little more cushioning as well - make sure you like them first vs. ordering the sports seats/package. I am 5'8 at 175 pounds so the base seats work for me. Overall, It's more luxurious, quieter and more fun than the previous generation (which was already great). I will have a hard time giving this up in 3 years.

My favorite attributes about BMW is the familiarity with the iDrive system and it's the only manufacturer in this segment where the passenger can enter an address into the Nav while the car is in drive.  I test drove Lexus/Audi and both required the car to be in park in order to enter an address into the nav (unless I wanted to use the voice recognition - which is always terrible)!  Anyway, this car is typical BMW - high end interior parts and all of the controls are where they should be.  Now I do have ONE gripe - the temperature controls only move in two degree increments and in even numbers only.  I contacted BMW about this and it's because the car is based off the MINI Countryman.  Let's not forget, this is an entry level BMW, so it's not the biggest deal for me.  Overall, I'm glad I got this SAV.

Title: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
Review:  Let me preface by saying my last three cars were Hondas. I wanted an upgrade with more pep and more luxury. So here goes - The Good: Acceleration - Amazing, Interior Space - Amazing (overall same length as my Honda Civic but the interior feels MASSIVE), the Technology package with bluetooth, handsfree phone etc. - Great, the Steering - Fantastic. OK The Bad - After two weeks the tow-hook cover in the front fell off, never to be seen again. Rear Visibility: Not great. Parking Assist - I live in LA and you really have to hurry your parking cause there's always someone behind you. The parking assist is either slow in figuring out there's a spot or it never figures it out. Pointless. Fuel Consumption - Not Great At All, I have it on Eco Mode most of the time and my average after 4000 miles with about 1000 highway no traffic driving is 22.3 mpg. The Ugly: The seats are TERRIBLE. The Ride is also TERRIBLE probably due to the runflat tires and maybe the suspension. I started researching how to replace the seats and the tires. Yes, it's that bad.

Title: My wife is now officially a "car girl"
Review:  I've always been a fan of BMW's, but this is the first one I've actually owned.  My wife and I test drove this and the X3 and quickly realized the fresh look of the new X1 and increased sized put in on par with the X3 from a space perspective.  I'm 6'4" 235lbs and can fit comfortably in any of the seats even with the front seat in the rearmost position.  It's been comfortable on several interstate trips and we love the zippy handling and performance around town.  We have also been impressed with the fuel mileage considering the sportiness this car offers.  Before we bought the BMW, I was the "car guy" in the family and my wife didn't really get too excited talking about cars.  Now that she's has her BMW she says she's never buying anything else and is very particular about keeping it clean inside and out while making sure she can find that perfect parking spot.  She's officially a "car girl" now! :-)We just recently hit 50,000 miles and the car has been flawless. We’re sad to see the included scheduled maintenance expire, but the only thing it’s had to cover so far is some font brake pads and oil/fluid changes.  We also had to buy a set of tires. My wife and I still love the car and will possibly upgrade to an X5 at some point to make those rare occasions when our adult children ride with us a little more spacious.

Title: It's a little/BIG SUV/SAV
Review:  I was cross shopping the Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, BMW X3, and Volkswagen GTI. And then I saw this new X1. I was thinking to wait for the next gen Q5, but I decided to buy this car. It’s a handsome car inside out. The interior is very spacious. The headroom and legroom are comparable or even bigger than the current Q5, GLC, X3, and GTI. It’s even comparable to the larger X5. (X5 vs X1: F head 40, 41.9; R head 39.3, 39.4; F leg 40, 40.4; R leg 36.6, 37) I am 5’10, 165 lbs, I fit in the back seat comfortably even when the front seat is all the way back. And my car is not even with the sliding rear seat option. The trunk is also big, fits $200+ groceries from Costco easily. The engine is potent. The transmission is smooth. The handle is nimble. The acceleration is quick. It’s fuel efficient. Overall it’s a very practical car. I understand it’s being categorized as a subcompact SUV/SAV, but you really have to test drive and get inside of the car to understand what I’m talking about. It’s BIG!!! OK, now the bad. The front seat is too narrow. The gas pedal is too close to the side wall of the center console. The center console storage is relatively small. There is still noticeable turbo lag when stop and go. The suspension is too hard, you can feel every tinny hole and bump on the road. The LED headlight and taillight only come with the premium package, and the price is pretty premium for that.

Title: Great mult-purpose vehicle
Review:  I looked at the Mercedes GLA, Audi Q3, and BMW X1.  The 2016 BMX X1 was by far the best.  A very practical vehicle, with excellent cargo and passenger room for a compact SUV.  Excellent performance and gas mileage from the 4 cyl turbo engine.  BMW handling and overall driving experience  is an added bonus.  I have owned two BMW 3 series sedans.  The handling is not as good a these, but the handling is better than any other compact SUV I have driven. The most value for the money compared to other luxury compact SUVs.

Title: Wouldn't Get Another One
Review:  Got stuck in a lease with one of these, I immediately regretted it. BMW must be paying for positive reviews, because it' not that stellar of a vehicle. The car has stylish looks, has many bells and whistles, and is fun to drive in Sport mode, but that's about it - everything else is like driving a typical 4-cylinder, kind of boring and sluggish. The worst part about the X1 is the interior comfort and design. The front seats are the worst I've ever seen, they have ZERO padding, way too firm like sitting on a park bench, they're also too narrow and high. The leather is very grippy and not smooth, tugs your shirt. The steering wheel obstructs the dashboard, you can't get a clear view of the entire instrumentation through the top hole of the steering wheel. The controls for the screen and navigation are horrible and feel 20 years old. Selecting single letters or digits to input an address into the nav? Forget it. It's also unsafe having to look down at the control wheel and buttons instead of up. I would not describe the whole system as intuitive at all. Outside temp only visible to the driver, no digital speedometer, annoying. The on-wheel radio controls are not the easiest to set up or navigate. The whole cabin instrumentation is just overcomplicated, and kind of Frankensteined with new and old. The screen looks like it should descend, but it doesn't, it's kind of unsightly like it's tacked on. MPG is so-so unless you drive in Eco mode which turns engine off at stops. Overall very disappointed with the X1. It looks like a BMW on the outside, but it isn't on the inside.

Title: Nice car, but dealership is worthless
Review:  I purchased my X1 new off the showroom floor and when leaving found a ding on the dash and a light was missing in the door.  Once home I noticed the front grill was missing.  I was told my BMW had navigation that talks, but it didn't.  I was told it had blind spot monitoring, but it didn't, this car has a serious blind spot.  The dealer wrote a "We Owe" to fix the dash.  Trying to get BMW to do anything is like pulling teeth.  2 months later ding is still there and no light.  Their response is, it's coming from Germany and we have to get approval.  Just make sure your X1 is in perfect condition when you leave, because it will never get fixed.  Sad to say this will be my last BMW because of the service I've received.  UPDATE:  Finally after contacting Better Business Bureau, Fields BMW replaced the dash and the light in the door.  It was also missing the front grill cover and they replaced it too.  This was a nightmare getting it done and I had to contact: BBB, BMW and every social media available.  It took me over 100 phone calls, most of which didn't get returned, to get the car in new condition.  After dash was replaced I traded it for a new Lexus ES350 that I love; mainly because I hated Fields BMW and didn't want to return and they own both BMW dealerships near me. UPDATE: I love my Lexus and only miss my BMW headlights.

It is everything that comes with the BMW name - great ride, wonderful exceleration, and just a pleasure to drive.  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but worth every penny.

Title: Xceptional!
Review:  3500 miles in and 5 stars in all aspects.  Based on my experience, it lives up to BMW's billing...best in class performance, fuel economy and cargo.  I evaluated other comparable models (Lexus NX, Acura RDX, Mercedes GLA, and Audi Q3) and chose the BMW X1.  Car and Driver rating 4.5 out of 5.It's roomier on the inside than it appears from the outside.  For both rows of seats, it actually has more head and leg room than the current BMW X3.  I highly recommend the optional sliding 2nd row seat to gain flexibility for passengers versus cargo.Well-engineered and easy to use information technology (iDrive, bluetooth, Navigation, etc.).  I didn't spec the safety technologies, so I can't comment on them.Give it a try - you won't be disappointed!

Title: So far, so good
Review:  I'm a new owner (bought a month ago), and have been pleased with the car so far in 1800 miles of driving. Admittedly, my previous car was a Scion, so any car in this range would have been a big step up. But I really enjoy the performance of the X1 - lots of extra power so that I can pass on the highway going uphill (I drive to Tahoe regularly). The traction works well in the snow so far. And it gets surprisingly good fuel efficiency - I mostly drive on the highway, and get 29-30 mpg on average. And I love the parking sensors - the rear-view camera, and the sonar to know when I'm getting close to obstacles while parking, are essential for parking in close quarters. The lumbar support is key as well on the long drives that I do. The controls (turn signals, windshield wipers, etc) are a bit funky and different than most cars so they take some time to learn, but I like the console control for the screen. And the Bluetooth integration with my phone works great for both playing audio and taking phone calls. So far, so good!

Review:  This car is great to drive! Great acceleration, great handling.  Easy to get in and out of. Does everything well.  My only disappointments are minor. For the amount paid for this vehicle, it's surprising that it did not come with power seats. The other thing that I notice is that the longer I have the vehicle, the worse my gas mileage gets.  Since I have had no mechanical issues with the car, I don't know what would affect the gas mileage.  I would expect gas mileage to get better over time, not worse (that' been my experience with my other BMW's - 2 3 series, 2 5 series. Overall, I would definitely recommend this vehicle.

Title: My $600 phone is easy to use $39,000 car is not
Review:  The car handles well and really shines on a 2 lane highway. Lags between 0-5 mph which is mildly annoying but otherwise is OK. I like the gas mileage and it is comfortable in the driver's seat. The problems: 1. Navigation - slow to acquire satellites and then 5 minutes later will alter your route based on traffic, this is sometimes too late to take a better route. My phone is much better. Also, if you decide to go a different route the system will keep trying to reroute you back to the original rather than recalculating. Once I went 70 miles and passed into the upper in Michigan before it recalculated. I was recently sent a notice that I could upgrade to current maps for $59 annually. This is pretty funny. 2. The bluetooth phone works OK, but it takes a minute or two to reload the phonebook from my phone each time. Why? Again my phone is better. At least the car bluetooth will pick up the call after I have made it on my phone. 3. Hands free control - you can speak controls but you have to know the exact sequence of words, for example for an address, you can't easily search for anything else, this is not really useful. Bottom line is that BMW should hire some Samsung or Apple engineers. Not sure I would buy again but would consider if they caught up with Fords on technology front.

Title: Awesome Ride
Review:  I got this car trading in a 2013 Jetta Sportwagen TDI polluter and could not be happier, even though I took a beating on the trade in value, thanks to VW's fraudulent practices.  We'll see if they ever make it right, but, I'm over it.  This BMW is an incredible machine.  It feels solid, looks fantastic outside, clean and elegant inside with wood trim and, most important, it is really, really fun to drive -- super responsive with a kick that will throw your head back in fourth gear, great acceleration from a dead stop, awesome handling, sweet engine sounds, just a beautiful little beast.  I've got a C7 Corvette, manual with sports package and this thing compares favorably in terms of driving dynamics.  I mean, driving to work every morning is a treat, not a chore.  My particular x1 is a loaded M Sport 35i -- don't think there's anything it hasn't got.  It's real comfortable inside -- I'm 6'1" and find the front seat roomy.  The controls are easy to use and the infotainment system I like much better than the one on the Corvette -- shorter learning curve, more intuitive.  I have no idea what the mileage is and don't care, really.  Whatever they say it is, I'm sure mine is much less because of the way I drive.  I did try the eco-boost thing and it does improve mileage -- there's a little readout that tell you how much, but, when it's on, the car doesn't drive like a BMW.  I think it's good for long highway trips when you're just going along at the speed limit for hours, but when you're actually driving the car, forget it.  You don't buy a car like this to save on gas.  For that, get a Prius.  So, bottom line, I am totally sold on this car.  I hate the fact that, for 2016, BMW ruined it, making it front wheel drive and sticking you with the smaller engine and the eight speed transmission, but, hey, I got the sweet spot, seems like and I will keep this car for a very long time.Update 8/3/17 Everything above is still true.  I'm always thinking about cars, but there is just no way I could sell this BMW.  I took it for a road trip earlier this year and it was great on a long drive, comfortable and, for me, the absolutely perfect size.  Looks like I'm stuck with it.  By the way, these cars are very hard to find.  I friend of mine wants one just like it and we looked regionally and, tricked out like mine, didn't find one.Update 2/3/18Same old story.  I'm buying an extended warranty to 100K on this baby.  I keep looking at stuff and don't see anything that matches it, so, since I've only got a two car garage, when I get to the place where I just can't resist the new car itch any longer, the C7 will have to go.  I love it, but I love this BMR more.  On the VW, I did finally get a few K from them.  I still took a loss and will never even look at a VW again, but something is better than nothing, as the say.Update 8/4/18No changes except for new tires.  Love this car.

Review:  I love my 2015 X1, and more so after driving a 2016. The 2015 X1 has a unique style and look that maintained classic BMW driver focused interior and handling. The Valencia orange makes the curves on the exterior pop. She handles beautifully and has been very dependable. The new X1 interior drives me nuts! It's cheesy! The 2015 is sleek and serious compared to the weird seat and dash configuration in the newer models. The 2015 knows what it's about and the 2016 is confused by trying to satisfy all the criticisms of the ignorant American car critics!

Title: X1 a poor man's Macan S
Review:  We needed to replace our car in the mountains for our vacation home and decided on the BMW X1 SAV. This is our 1st BMW (currently I drive a Porsche 997 C2 Cab and my wife drives a Porsche Cayenne S at our main home) and initially after test driving liked it (but I was leaning toward a Volvo V60 Cross Country...but was unable to work out the deal that I wanted) but after driving it for 2 weeks I more than like it! Amazing performance (for a turbo 4) and great gas mileage. Handling is superb....not my 911 type of handling...as it is not a sports car, but for what it is and for it's price tag superb. The best I have driven up to the Macan (which is in a totally different category all together!). There are a few downsides which are lack of storage inside the vehicle (ours is a 2015 and I have been told that it has been somewhat rectified with the 2016 year model) and...maybe just 1 downside then! Very happy so far.

Review:  Number of things that bother me.1. front door handles will pinch the fire out of your fingers if you are not careful.2. after 600 miles the car only gets 18.2 mpg in Dallas traffic.  8 miles below what they say it should get.3. not much of a pickup4. wheel base porpoises a lot.UPDATE ON 3/8/2016 -  MPG is still crappy for this type of vehicle , plus what is reported by BMW.  Front door handles are poorly designed.  Will really pinch you, if not careful.  Now have about 1700 miles on automobile.  Would not buy one again.Just had interesting experience on this vehicle on 6/25/16.  Had nail in left rear tire, and it could not repaired. Found out that there are 3 run flat tires which cannot be repaired and you have to buy a new one.   The BMW X1 uses Pirelli, and that is one of the 3.  Be sure, before you buy, to find if your run flats can be repaired.  Very important.Update on 6/28/17 - still not happy with gas mileage, as advertised.  yesterday, it 17.2 for a tank of gasoline.

Title: Sport Hatchback that BMW doen't technically make
Review:  I know that everyone is jumping in the small crossover SUV pool but the X-1 (in my opinion) doesn't really strike me as an SUV.  What it strikes me as is a 3 Series of 2 generations ago, re-imagined as a sport hatchback.  I've had mine for a couple months and I really couldn't be happier with my decision.  Mine is loaded: Ultimate package, X-Line package, Adaptive Xenon Lighting package, Cold-weather package, etc. but I bought it as a dealer demo with 6,800 miles on it so it was about $8,000 or so below sticker.  We are empty-nesters and my wife has a Ford Explorer so I really could have gotten by with a smaller sport sedan or even a coupe (I test drove both).  However, I am a cyclist and backpacker so having a bit more utility in the vehicle I drive every day kind of put the X-1 over the top for me.  Plus the price was lower than a 3 series or a 228i AND I really don't feel like I gave up much in the way of driving dynamics.  With 240hp and 260 lb/ft of torque, there is simply gobs of power on tap in this 3,500 lb car.  I got the rwd version (we don't get much snow if any) so it handles like a true German sports sedan.  It's shorter (nose-to-tail), narrower and lighter than the 3 Series wagon and it's like 9 inches shorter (in height) than the X3 so it really is more of a hatchback than a wagon or SUV.  I also like that it has 7" of ground clearance: not enough to introduce too much lean in the corners, but enough to not have to worry about hitting curbs and parking barriers in parking lots.  It's a very nice touring car on your favorite 2 lane hwy (or even the interstate) and it scoots around town or back roads as zippy as you want to.  It has plenty of headroom in front and back.  Negatives?  Leg room in the back is a bit tight for adults, only 2 will comfortably ride in the back (due to the transmission tunnel), and there's a bit too much wind and road noise on the interstate for a BMW (in my opinion--having owned BMWs before).  All of that I can live with because the virtues of this car far outweigh the negatives.

Title: Goldilocks Size, Gold Bullion Price
Review:  Replaced our 325iT because the new "Sportwagons" only came in AWD - out of our price range, heavy, and lower performance. A base model is affordable by BMW standards, but to get the rear-view camera, we had to buy the costly nav and "driver assist" packages. (This may not be true with the new X1 that's on the Mini chassis.) The best interior (IMO) is the extra cost Terra/Petrol leather (Milk chocolate with white/blue piping) which only came with the extra cost XLine Package that included 18 inch lower profile (harsher riding and more expensive to replace) tires. Not really for a large family of large people, but for our purposes, occasionally carrying four normal size adults, it's perfect. All that said, we stretched our budget for a well optioned car with a sticker of $49,500 and we love it. Downside: It came with run-flat tires, unrepairable, harder-riding and expensive to replace. The newer X1s can be had with a limited-service spare and non-run-flat tires.

Title: Still satisfied but not amazed
Review:  After 30,000  miles in good and bad weather, I would say I'm satisfied but not amazed with the X1. This SAV is responsive and handles well. I was impressed with the stability in snow and ice. My disappointment is mostly with the base bluetooth interface. Old technology and not what should be standard on a premium vehicle.Like the transmission, hate the shifter. Is it a great value? Is it the best vehicle of its type? Perhaps not. It is my 5th BMW and 2nd currently owned. (Z4) something keeps bringing me back. If not the ultimate driving machine, it's a drivers vehicle and you don't get that from a subaru. Enough said. Update: 24,000 miles, MPG is avg24. On highway not any better. Gear selector is terrible and for this price point the Bluetooth should be much better. Overall, it's okay just not great. Least inspired of the 5 BMWs I've owned.

Title: fun exciting peppy little cuv - very pleased.
Review:  Very cool good looking high build quality vehicle with peppy engine and precise steering with good road feel but still highly comfortable and luxurious. If you are not looking for a big vehicle, then this is definitely the one to get since it is more practical than a sedan like 3-series, but with all its fun. It is not cheap as some people suggest - if you add up all the options that are standard on 3-series, it gets more expensive than a 3-series. So in that sense it is better since the options are just that - optional.

Title: quick and nimble with no cost maintenance.  sign me up.
Review:  i have now 13k miles on my X1. i got the 4 cylinder but it is very quick with 250lb torque. steering is precise and after 13k miles there is no problem and tires and brakes are fine.  person wrote brakes gave out after 1,000 miles?  he must be a cadillac dealer.  there is no way they give out and if they did BMW replaces them.  the start stop feature saves gas but it's optional to use.  i turn it off mostly so i can have more fun but it is optional, so it's not an issue.  the back seat is small.  the cargo is small.  it is not an SUV.  it's a cross over.

Title: 8 Months in an X1
Review:  This is my first BMW after three years in a Subaru Outback 3.6R.  I'm a guy who likes to get pushed back in my seat when I step on the gas, so I'm always looking for a way to balance that need with fuel use.  The Subaru's 6 gave me the acceleration I want and generally I loved the Outback but found the fuel economy very disappointing.  I live in Brooklyn, NY - so just think traffic that is about as tough on fuel economy as you get.  So at the end of my lease, I test drove an X1 figuring that the turbo 4 gave me a chance to have my cake (acceleration) and eat it too (decent gas mileage).  That theory is paying off so far.  The X1 is quick and nimble - probably a half second faster - to 60 than the 3.6R and my gas mileage is averaging about 4 - 5 mpg better and much better on the highway.  I drove the car on a 1300 mile trip down the east coast and back and averaged just about 30 mpg (80 mile per hour on cruise control most of the way). The Outback never approached that kind of fuel efficiency.  The Outback did have more room in the cabin especially for the rear seat passengers (my now grown kids are complaining about comfort on longer trips).  The 3.6R also had a smoother ride over bumpy roads as the X1's stiffness and added sportiness comes at the cost of a smooth ride.  But the slightly smaller length and width of the X1 is a big benefit when parking - especially on the street.  I think for me the X1 beats the Outback in most of the other categories that matter to me - aesthetics too.  My only other beefs would be the bluetooth entertainment system and the driver memory settings (it can supposedly store at least 2).  To this day we can't figure out why the bluetooth bounces between mine and my wife's phone when we are both in the car and we prefer using waze on our phones to the navigation that comes with the X1 - so with bluetooth connection - consistency matters.  It also is irritating that if your phone is connected wirelessly and then you decide to connect it to the usb - the car disconnects and you have to reconnect.  Finally - For some reason the car keeps losing my settings when I select them - so I'm planning on going back to the dealership to see what's up with that.  I'm a pretty picky person, so I don't want the gripes to make readers think I'm not happy with the car - overall it's one of the best car's I've owned and a very good value for the dough.

Title: Out With The Old..In With The New
Review:  We have had our X1 2017 for 14 months. Positive comments include terrific pick up, unencumbered interior, a nice tight turning radius, a huge panoramic moon roof [option], bold styling ,outstanding heater/air conditioning and a good value for a new Beemer. As well, if living in a colder climate, DO spring for the heated front seats and steering wheel. They are worth every penny. Lastly, in 2017 many options were standalone so the cost was individualized, not part of a more expensive package.Needed improvements include 1.MUCH more comfortable front seats. Our options included sport seats after reading the consumer reviews, which were right on. Even the sport seats are narrow and very firm. We have had 5 other Beemers and never had an issue with the seat comfort. 2. Considerable road noise. We have 19" upgraded tires[run flat] and they might contribute to the level of noise. 3. BE CAREFUL!! The 'sliding rear seat' option does provide for more cargo room[ about 4 "] but since the regular position of the rear seat without the option almost abuts the rear wheel well already, you only gain about an inch of additional rear legroom by paying for this option. It's simply not worth it unless additional cargo room is a priority. I am 6' 3" and need to move the front seat all the way back, leaving a tight area for legroom behind my driver's seat. BMW did curtail their warranty so be advised that items covered in the past now cost the consumer[e.g. windshield wipers replacement during scheduled service- standard in the past... over $30.00 EACH now] The length of the warranty has been modified as well.   UPDATE.....The X1 is built in Germany, unlike the X3 and 5. I took a sleighride with our X1 this past winter and quickly discovered that the Potenza tires were exclusively SUMMER tires . Be advised that I believe Germany does not recognize all season tires- only summer or winter. I was informed that winter tires are required and cars without them can be ticketed in Germany. SO....IF that is accurate, since we ordered our car from Germany in April, it came equipped with summer tires. We will be switching to all season within the next year. Lastly, the Potenza tires, while enabling the car to maneuver well does not appear to wear well. At 17,00 miles, the tread is 3/4 gone....NOT impressive.

Title: 2017 X1, My 13th BMW
Review:  This is a small SUV, but it holds me very well, 6'3 255lbs. This small version of an SUV has an comfortable ride, a little stiff for some, but not for BMWers. It handles very very well. Superior acceleration for a 4cyl engine. Good visibility all the way around.This X1 is fully loaded, but a blind spot monitor was not available at any cost. It must be the only BMW without that option. Why? I think the BSP is a great option, it has saved me a couple of times from cutting somebody off or even an accident that would have been my fault. My wife drives the car mostly, and she loves it. Small enough so that she can park and maneuver around things fairly easily, but large enough to feel like you have some metal between you and the other idiots who drive so nutsy on our local roads. I find the interior of the X1 a little inferior in quality materials from other BMW's, still good stuff, but somehow it seems a little weak for a BMW. The technology and especially the layout of the interior is the best there is, anywhere. We test drove the Audi Q3, Lexus NX, BMW was a clear winner over these two comparable models. I would give this BMW 4.5 stars if not for the lacking BSP. It only gets 4 as is. My 2006 M3 convertible soft top is still my favorite, it gets a 5 along with my Porsche Macan S, the only two cars I have ever given a 5 rating to, and I have owned LOTS of high end cars and SUV's. Cheers............... Update......... 6 months in, very happy with the car. My wife drives it mostly and she loves it. Perfect size and good fuel economy for all the running around she does.

Title: Great Truck
Review:  Excellent drivability. This truck has more power than the comparable Ford or Dodge, better mileage, and is MUCH quieter! (I'm a Dodge man) Mileage varies from 22 (cruise at 55mph, no load) to 12 (90mph with truck loaded and 14,000lb trailer). Plently of room in the cab and a full length bed too! Only problem with the truck is the moonroof has stuck open 3 times and lots of wind noise when open. The moonroof cover is designed more like a screen - the sun sure gets hot at an angle that directly shines on driver. The original tires had sidewall integrity problems at 55K. Goodyear great with warranty issues. The fuel gage takes a while to show that the tank is actually full (10min - 1hour).

Many Diesel magazines have given this truck its best in class award, and for good reason. Its a very comfortable truck to drive and loves to be hot rodded around.  I'm at 45000 miles looking forward to many years of driving and towing with this. I added a Delco navigation unit plus a Delco 6 cd changer, it was well worth the price.

Title: 2007 GMC 3500 carbon monoxide in cab.
Review:  Having driven this truck only a short distance, 2400 miles, problems are already evident. The worst being a diagnosis, from a blood sample test, of carbon monoxide poisoning due to cab infilteration. This is caused by the missfiring of the injection electronics package and the poor cab fit and finish allowing the engine exhaust to get into the cab unless the recirculate mode is used on the heating system. Recirculate is defeated by the controller which will not allow the recirculate mode to be engaged except on max ac. The engine has very poor throttle response and smokes excessively under heavy acceleration. The engine has a propensity to consume oil.

Still the same title for sure but now worse, entire dashboard is not functional, speedo does not work, all other gages peg out when starting the truck.  At least it is running-mostly. I have to hand pump the diesel filter to get the truck to start.  Happens about once a month or so.  (no it is not standar maintenance issue).  Replacing the batteries annually now (seems something is draining them when I am not looking!)I have received a call from Cust support about the dealer charge offering to reimburse some payment.  I would have even considered changing my review if he would have helped.  Then he disappeared!From the Dealer using my truck to tow the owners horse trailer (when turned in for maintenance) and adding 100 miles to it...to the more than $3000 I had to put into the electrical within 3 months-to the instrument panel stopping to work (speedo, then oil pressure, then battery-which comes and goes) $900 fix it so I just use a GPS for my speedo-to the rattle in the steering because of design issue always going out....to the electric seat positioning clicking 7-8 times before settling into place-to now the heater/AC blower stopped working and a cost of $750 to fix it at PEP Boys.Thanks to youtube the heater fix will only cost me $150 in parts.(my friend just had the same thing happen to his Tahoe and had to pay $750)The heater went out again in a couple of weeks.  replace resistor again, heater stopped again!Either this truck is a lemon OR my favorite GMC's are on their way out of business.(I am in Quality management and would not have allowed anything close to this happening where I work)

So far I am fully satisfied although I only have 30,000 km and time will provide more information on reliability of the Duramax.  I find it fun to drive and fuel efficiency is good compared to the other diesel (Ford & Chrysler).  It provide plenty of performance compare to a gas engine. The interior is perhaps blend as per the critics but it provides a price advantage compare to the Ford's King Ranch.  It does not take away from the performance.

They work well,  but don't last many miles.  With a 454  V8, 4.10 rear end, and automatic trans,  I get 9-10 MPG.  It is a great family  hauler, and the 4WD has saved me twice  from getting stuck and needing a tow.   Mods I did were additional rear helper  springs, air suspension, Bilstein  shocks, and load range G rear tires  (Goodyear). I do NOT have dual rear  wheels.

Review:  This is my 2nd GM diesel truck and it  has operated flawlessly since delivery.  The power and accelleration for a big  truck makes it fun to drive. I tow a  14000 lb 5th wheel and can pass with  ease going over the mountains. The  mileage is about 10mpg with the trailer  and running 65, without it runs about  18-19 mpg on the highway.

Title: A Real Truck
Review:  This vehicle has surpassed all our  expectations (except for the dealer who  is mediocre).  The cabin noise level is  lower than most of the cars that I have  owned in the last 15 years.  Build  quality is improved over the 95 GMC  that I owned.  I tow 10 to 13K pound  loads on a daily basis.  Hauling horses  I routinely discuss trucks with other  guys at horse events.  I find that I  can out haul them, get slightly better  gas mileage and the TRUCK IS IN THE  SHOP less than my Ford F350 friends  (one of whom has sold his to buy a  Chevy 3500).  If you are looking for a  real work rig, this is it.

Review:  Great Truck! I have had no eng. or trans. problems with this truck. It will pull anything I have hooked to it from a car hauler to a 18ft flatbed trailer with no problem. Gas mileage is alright(15 in town, 18 hwy). Since this is a 1 ton truck I think gas mileage is not bad. Insurance company rates it as commerical (even though I do not use it that way) so insurance is cheaper. As a mother I am always always concerned about safety. I feel that my family is very secure in this truck. With it being a long wheel base it is somewhat hard to park(takes up more then one space). I have a GMC Yukon XL and I like driving the truck more. If you are looking for a truck I highly recommend this one!!!

Review:  I tried a small car and it just doesn't work for me.  I wanted a big truck with the best mileage I could get and the Sierra Hybrid delivers big time!  I am averaging between 20 - 21.5 MPG in the city and about the same on the highway.  I have taken the family to the beach twice and it handles deep sand with no problems at all.  The kids love all the room in the back seat.  It is fun to drive.  Drives really well on the interstate, plenty of power.  Don't let the hybrid fool you.  Had the vehicle for 3 months now and would buy it again today.

Title: Sierra Hybrid 4WD 2010
Review:  This is a great truck, we like it better all the time and would recommend it to anyone needing a truck for work and family.  Acceleration and ride are very good.  The 2010 model brakes have a linear response, gear changing and engine stopping/restarting are smooth and quick, and there are more cup holders and storage compartments.   After 6400 miles we had 20-22 mpg hwy (at pump), 20 mpg  mixed local driving, and 19 mpg city. Gas savings estimated to be $600/yr at $3/gal and 10K mi/yr. Subtracting out $2200 hybrid tax credit, savings would pay for the difference in price in 3 years.      Only one minor problem, a tire pressure sensor went out. Has an 8 year warranty on hybrid components.

Title: Better Than Critics Give Credit
Review:  This is a surprisingly nice vehicle and the savvy negotiator can get a good deal, make a few add-ons and end up with a really nice truck with great gas mileage.  I am amazed at how quiet it can be and how real the improved gas mileage is.  I think that professional critics miss the fact that many people will be coming from older trucks and so any new truck today has a lot more to offer than trucks from days past.  This truck has a very solid and quiet feel to it while maintaining the versatility of a full size pickup.  They run e85 Fuel as well and in KS you can get a $750 credit if you use 500 GL in a year.  I am very impressed overall with this truck!

Review:  Cruise control doesn't work well if at all down hill. Tried Asking GM customer service VIA the phone about it. But the problem with this is, they just do not know and try to read the owners manual to you,  Their is no information on how it works or even if it works in the owners manual. They are providing this support from their centers around  World.. (One insisted Hydromantic meant Hybrid transmission). My Dodge manual - states clearly + or - 2 MPH down hill. I took it in to my dealer and said it doesnt hold on any hill I drive (unlike all my other vehicles. They said they can't fix it as their GM Tec paper states it may work or it may not, depending on the hill, and to down shift.

The dealer where my Sierra Hybrid was sourced neglected to update my software.  Updating software fixed the brake problem and a faulty transmission pump fixed the gear shifting problem.  My Sierra now drives just like a standard Sierra and I'm a huge fan and I can confidently say that I would absolutely recommend this truck.

Review:  I recently purchased a 2009 Sierra Hybrid, 2WD truck.  My initial impression is that this is a great vehicle.  I have all of the standard features of a Sierra with gas mileage averaging 21 MPG combined City/Highway.  Outstanding!  Contrary to Expert reviews, I would not agree with assessments that transitions shifts between electric and gas as seamless.  On the contrary, these transitions can be felt-- abruptly in some instances.  I also have concerns regarding the transition between regenerative and hydraulic brakes.  In some instances, my brakes have actually disengaged momentarily making me feel as though I might roll into the vehicle in front of me.  A very uncomfortable feeling.

Title: Sierra 1500
Review:  The overall quality of this heavily discounted truck is finally approaching the Asian level. Fit is rather OK, but the finish is excellent, both inside and out. Engine is very quiet, smooth, and the power is more than adequate. A/C is superb, and the full compliment of gauges is quite welcomed. EPA shows 16/21 and thus far I'm realizing close to that. Have always had 4WD trucks for useless reasons, and the difference in 2WD ride quality/mileage is astounding.  I would recommend opting for the locking rear axle though, as the low end torque placed on the standard axle simply overwhelms the drive tire in certain situations. So far this very handy vehicle is all and more than advertised.

Review:  I have made four trips from Houston TX to the DC area, a trip to the mountains (off-road) in Colarado, as well as my daily commute. This truck rides and drives great with a comfortable cab. The 5.3 liter V8 provides the power I want without losing the MPG of a larger engine. Could it be improved, sure.  Probably has in the newer model. I would add storage capacity in-cab, as well as more functionality for cup holders and the like. I consistently get 15 MPG in town, and 20 MPG on the road. Who would not want more? But that's probably as good as any full size truck.  Would I buy again?  You bet.

Title: QUIRKY AND PRACTICAL
Review:  4 years with our element. Honestly there isn't much to complain about it, but I just never grew to love it. The transmission annoys me, it's constantly hunting thru the gear, yes, I know it's getting me the best mileage it can. The shifts aren't hard or harsh. In fact they aren't unpleasant at all, I just find it annoying listening to the engine cycle up and down as the trans constantly shifts at every rise or dip in the road. The highway at 70 is truly busy for the transmission. Road noise is a bit on the loud side as well. Crosswinds are fairly disruptive, pushing the car around on the road. The rear doors are a love/hate item for me as well. There is a different routine to using them in parking lots and requires some forethought. Getting in/out with kids can be an exercise in frustration. I've been trapped between the doors many times, doing some sort of dance/juggling to get into position to be able to get out from between the doors so they can be closed. The doors open about 90 degrees which makes getting in/out and loading easier but brings the doors in range of neighboring cars in parking lots. When a 5 yr old leans on the door to get out it is simple for the door to swing open enough to bump the car beside you. Aside from the low tire pressure monitor coming on and staying on about a year after we got the car it has been almost faultless. Fuel mileage is not very good. we get about 22-23 most of the time, a mile or 2 less in the winter and it will get 24+ on the highway at speed. the best mileage I've seen was 26. On the plus side, it's roomy, for its size. The seats fold flat or swing up clearing most of the floor. They can be removed but I'd rather take a punch from mike Tyson. Our 5 year old loves to "decorate" the car by drawing on the matte black plastic panels with sidewalk chalk. It's a nice conversation piece. The people at my wife's work love it. It is an excellent choice for someone with small kids and/or dogs. We fold the back flat on one seat (rear) and our great Dane lays there next to the kid in his car seat.            3-6-18. still have this thing. we will probably be trading it in the next few months when we decide on a replacement. It has held up pretty well. The seats have stains and the passenger side dash has a weird discoloration on the accent panel. The tach needle fell off about 6 months ago. there is a rust spot on the driverside rear door. all in al we got our moneys worth out of it. going on 160,000 miles.

Title: Go Anywhere with your Element
Review:  I have owned my Element since 2007 when I purchased it NEW.   It has been a great little SUV.  Have almost 88,000 miles on it.  It will plow through snow with the best of other suvs.  I have done a lot of winter driving here in Interior Alaska, the heaters have kept me warm.  The stopping ability on icy roads is wonderful.  If they still made them I would buy a NEW one, but they don't make them anymore. I have the all wheel drive version. Am still very happy with my Element.  Am thinking about replacing it with a new rig this year, as I would like to have some of the new safety features on a vehicle I drive daily.  I think Honda made a real mistake not continuing this utilitarian vehicle.  It has been a great little car.  The newer Honda's do not have the ground clearance I would like to have, we have had 80 inches of snow since December and getting around in a car with less clearance would create problems.

It has served us reliably well as you hope from a honda with 2 exceptions. right after the warranty expired we had to shell out 500 bucks to replace a rear strut that was gone. and the original battery left us stranded multiple times when it was only 3y old. . i read on blogs that many people had that problem. since it got replaced, out of my pocket, that issue is gone. the door design is weird if you have people actually using the rear seats. especially in tight parking spots. you get trapped in the space between 2 doors. it gets worse if you have to get little children out of their child seats in the rear.

The turning radius is very good!The build quality was great, and I had no problems with the engine just regular maintenance. My only problems were with the "realtime" all wheel drive and the cargo capacity. This car is marketed as a young adventure vehicle. Well with a gross payload of 600ish lbs.....4 people generally hits the limit so no gear, as long as you keep it light your ok.

It was a stroke of luck the dealer had the Element available. Yes it is a bit bouncy but I was very impressed with everything on the Element. Even being 3 almost 4 years old it was turning heads, I got the silver S C. A very handsome and very practical car. If you are looking for a Cadillac ride you wont like it.

It took me 5 years to call myself the owner of an Element, but I've never looked back. I love my car. It drives like a dream! I took the back seats out so I'd have room for my dogs. I have never missed carpet. The resilient plastic flooring is ideal, especially when it comes to cleaning (which I'm not so good at because I live in a rural, dirt road area). But, at least when I do clean, I can do it with a bucket of soapy water and a rag--and it gleams!

Review:  I have put 55,000 miles on this car and it has been a pleasure.  The Element handles extremely well in snow and out-performed 4wd vehicles on a recent ski trip in the West Virginia mountains.  I drove the ELement to Miami and back and found the seats to be very comfortable and the open cabin a definite plus.  My only complaint is that I had to replace the tires at 30,000 miles.  I put Michelin tires on and they have 25,000 miles on them with very little wear.  The Element makes corrections in snow and ice that make driving in extreme conditions safe.  On the beach the Element handled well, although I didn't push it and enter the soft sand.  Overall, an outstanding utility vehicle!!!

Review:  I bought the gold looking element for its looks and roominess. It looks very different from other SUV's and it has great cargo room capabilities. The car has been very useful in many ways, but I have several issues with it. It has 42k miles and I have replaced both front and rear brakes and still the brakes are working poorly, I'm sure it may need additional brakes work. The tire pressure monitoring system stays on all winter, the dealer said it was normal for this car. I have replaced the windshield once, it needs a new set of tires soon, the dashboard makes cracking noises during winter, it may need alignment again. Otherwise the engine and transmission work fine.

Title: Dont knock it till u try it....
Review:  I fell in love with the Element when the very first one came out, with the exception of the panel on the vehicle. In '07 when I saw the SC I fell in love all over again. This car may look like a toaster, but from the inside out it is an exceptional vehicle. I love the room it provides on the inside to how there's no panel on the outside. I've had my SC since Nov. '06 and still have it today with over 37,000 miles on it and I haven't had to this day any problems with my SC, except taking it in for regular maintenance. I feel it's one of the best investments u'll ever make and u wont regret it one bit. For everyone else who's had problems I think it's the driver not the car!

Title: Element SC - Too many problems
Review:  Cons: The Element is my first Honda and probably the last. Reliability and build quality was surprisingly poor with subpar components. Tires wore out at 24,000 miles, all new brakes (rotors  & pads) at 30,000, speedometer broke at 5,000 miles, windshield replaced twice with mystery cracking, drivers seat cushioning compressed and wrinkled, and scheduled services are over priced.  The ride of the SC model is very harsh if the road is less than perfect - I had to stop drinking coffee in the car due to it too easily splashing. Brakes are noisy even shortly after replacement. Very uncomfortable for long drives due to no "dead pedal".

Title: 2007 element
Review:  I love my Honda element. This is my second one. Only issue i have is that this is the second time that the master brake cylinder went out after about 29,000 miles. It was under warranty. I also had a 2004 element and the same thing happened. Kinda odd that it would go out in my 2007 element. I think Honda should check into a internal leap problem in the master brake cylinder. Other wise, I love my element.  thanks.

Title: Who didn't love the Ugly Duckling?"
Review:  Okay, when my Dad owned one in Silver I totally thought it looked like a toaster.  He raved about it, so when the lease on my 2004 Grand Cherokee was up I thought what the heck (always been a Jeep girl) Test drove the Element and the CR-V and to be honest the CR-V was teeny inside, my husband is 6'5" and he has plenty of room, so do my two boys.  I love the ease of a rubber floor with two kids and the special order stain proof fabric on my EX.  But most of all Mommy loves cranking up the tunes on the killer stereo system.  Super fun to drive & own.  Better than any Jeep I have ever had, more fun to drive, better gas mileage and AWD if I ever need it!

Review:  I love my Honda Element but the blinds spots are annoying when backing up. I have had to replace the brakes on the rear after only 17,000 miles. Honda Corp. has not followed up on my complain either to resolve the issue. I have owned many vehicles and have never had to service calipers or replace brakes with so little miles. Very disappointed in Honda in how they handled the issue.

Review:  I was in love with the element from day one, it took me until 2006 to finally take a look inside . I was hooked! In dec. 2006 my dealer found a 2007 kiwi lx manual I ordered and bought it on the spot, no test drive needed. I read different reviews for people wanting carpet,  different shifter location etc. For them I say "get a normal car." the Element is not for everyone,  but good for children, pets, hauling things and having fun.

Title: Great SUV
Review:  OK, I confess: I did convince the dealership to put carpet, floor mats, and the SC wheels on my E. There, I said it. Notwithstanding, I really love this vehicle. With the 18s it corners better than my 2007 Camry SE (manual) did. I am really amazed. True, it is not the most aerodynamic vehicle on the road, but it'll pass. I love the versatility of cargo space usage. I can get a lot of stuff inside, like 6 foot trees, etc. It makes trips to home improvement stores a breeze. I like that it takes up less floor space in my garage too. It's odd that a vehicle with so much interior room is shorter than a Corolla. I enjoy my E.

Title: Love My Toaster!
Review:  When I first saw this vehicle, I thought it was one of the ugliest vehicles on the road - I nicknamed it the toaster. My son and I went shopping with my husband for a Ridgeline.  While my husband was discussing the terms for the Ridgeline, my son and I checked out the Element.  Once we sat inside of it, we fell in love with it.  We went for a test drive that day - within two weeks I had my Element.  I love it, and now I find it quite cute.  It's fun to drive, very utilitarian.  We've carted everything from a flag pole, gardening tools, plants, baseball equipment, fishing poles to our Springer Spaniel with ease.  The car makes everyday rides fun adventures.

Review:  We bought a 2007 Honda element  sc model silver,  18 inch mags sc package, right now it has a little under 6000 miles on it and its been in the Honda shop a total of 4 times. First it had a noise underneath the driver side, so they said it was a strut assembly. The replaced under warranty which is good still the noise was there. We take it back the second time for another kind of noise on the driver side doors they adjusted them fixed for a while again back in the shop now said they hooked up some microphones all over it and found out the noise underneath is the steering rack?  So in the shop again  oh yea this thing gets very poor gas mileage, the power is lackluster and the windows are noisy

I have used it for family vacations, football tailgating, commuting, hauling large items to the dump, taking the dog swimming, and kayak fishing.  I plan to go camping in it this spring.  It is without a doubt the most useful and fun vehicle to drive and own that I have ever had!!!

Title: 07 Element EX AWD MT review
Review:  I have had my E for almost 7 months now.  Included in my 16000 miles is a 6300 miles across the US trip from GA to AK (yes, Alaska).  I towed a 1500# trailer behind it the entire way.  I have absolutely no complaints about the comfort of the seats (even after 10-12 hours).  The creature comforts and convenience items were well placed, easy to reach, and worked wonderful.  The utilitarianism (is that a word?) of the vehicle is fantastic.  We have made the decision to buy a second one to replace our other small SUV.  IMHO - you won't regret getting one.

Title: Element is a good little car
Review:  I was drawn to the Element by the interior flexibility and suicide doors and it doesn't look like a mini-van.  My previous car, however was a Subaru Forester and I think Honda could take some lessons from Subaru on building AWD drive trains.  This car has torque steer on hard acceleration and there is a lot of wheel spin on wet pavement. Once you get the element going, it's a hoot to drive.  I am interested, though, to see how this car will perform in snow (a little worried).  The ABS works well which will be good for snow driving.  I miss not having the headlights turn off when I turn the ignition off, although, the warning bell has kept me out of trouble so far.  I could do without sunroof

Title: The Element
Review:  I was first concerned about the location of the stick shift lever.  However, the location is in a suitable place and this is not an issue.  The manual transmission aids the driver to control the vehicle and requires little effort to employ.  Both the suspension and transmission handles very well.  I preferred the manual over the automatic after test driving both vehicles.  The Elements large interior dwarfs my 1997 Grand Cherokee.  Very large or older adults can enter and exit the rear seat of the Element with ease.  The rear seats can be configured to carry various loads. This is important to both home owners and active individuals that participate in outdoor activities.

Title: Finally, logic built into a car
Review:  The Element is the ultimate utilitarian vehicle. I love the flexibility of having a large cargo area. The entire interior is easy to clean, I am never worried about getting it muddy, wet, or dirty. There is tremendous flexibility with the cargo area since the seats go up. The AWD works great, I've been through heavy snow with great results.  On long drives I fit a twin size air mattress in the back and sleep 2 people. I can fit just about anything in the back (bikes, sofas, tons of gear, etc).  It seems like every inch of this car is build purely on logic. It's a no frills car that is brilliant in its simplicity. Hey, it took genius to discover E=mc^2, the element follows in that tradition.

Review:  It's exactly what I expected. Only car I have ever owned in which I do not get a backache-amazing support on short or long trips.  Split rear door is extremely efficient-infinitely better than most splits & better than all single doors. Very useful for utility, carrying big & lots of things.  Great traction in snow.  Only 3 negatives which I expected:rear seat is useful only in a pinch; had to remove headrests from rear seats to see, but don't use them anyway;choppy ride. Otherwise turning radius is great,headlights great,lots of stg places,easy to clean. Got armrest stg option, and love it. Would not suggest for young kids with carseats. Great for dogs-leave backs of rear seats down always

Title: Look of a Jeep, Quality of a Honda
Review:  We purchased this on a whim. We were looking into the CR-Vs but when I got in it It was too small, o we checked out the Element. What a nice ride. The seats are very comfortable and the "theater" style seating is cool. Much better stability than most SUVs. To be honest, seeing these on the road didn't seem appealing to me, but the moment I test drove this car I was hooked. It's a fun car to drive. This is the 4th Honda we have owned (5th if you include the 1990 Acura Integra) and I wouldn't trade any of them for another vehicle. We got the Nighthawk black pearl. So far this is the only vehicle I have owned that I didn't noticed a ton of before and especially after purchasing on the road.  I'm so satisfied with this vehicle I will probably buy a second one later on down the road But will probably have to pry the Keys to our 2 door Civic from me.

Review:  I have 3,000 miles on my black 2007 SC and have not been dissappointed with its looks, performance, ride comfort, transporting capacity and its good looks inside & out. The XM radio performance is outstanding!  Front seating is quite cmfortable and provides very good stability in turns. The disc brakes are super smooth and stop the vehicle quickly without any nose-diving or pitching.  The factory Goodyear tires give a luxury-sedan ride and road grip with responsive handling.  I added a rear spoiler to top off the good looks. I would have added fog lights but they are overpriced ($400.00 is a bit heavy on the wallet).  You won't be disappointed at all getting an SC!

Review:  I chose the EX because I did not want carpeting,just vacuum and wipe down with a sponge. EX features are worth the extra cost over the LX, map light, arm rests, stereo, ect.In Florida rainstorms,the AWD is great.I carry lots of gear and you can configure the back end many different ways.I love the feel. A bit of road noise but the sound system in the EX drowns it out. I would like better mpg.I get 19cty and 24hwy. I recommend fog lights and the optional console for extra storage space. I HATE the sunroof!  There should be a sliding cover to keep out the heat.  In Florida, my backseat passengers are cooking!  I plan on getting extra heavy tint for that. I recommend it and would buy it again.

Title: Good Little SUV
Review:  I bought my 2007 Honda Element EX in May, 2007, and I've put about 3,000 miles on it so far. It's run fine with no problems.  The 166 HP engine is smooth and peppy, but it isn't going to win any drag races. Fuel economy around town is only about 18 mpg, but I've been getting 29-30 mpg on the highway. This car is great for hauling my eight-year old son and his gear and is great for hauling my bicycle to rides. I don't have to take the front wheel off.  I just fold one of the rear seats up on the side of the car and throw my bike in the back. The front seats are comfortable and firm. Plenty of head room (I'm 6'2"). Plenty of leg room in the back seat, too.

Review:  The new 2007 Honda Element is a pleasure to drive. It's peppy, runs smoothly, and has tons of room. I knew I liked the Element when I first saw it  a few years ago. It was "boxy" looking but different than all the other SUVs. And the colors, esp. that unusual orange, were unique. I see people looking at it and in it sometimes. To me all the other SUVs look so much alike.  The Element, though it's not so new anymore, has such a striking appearance that it maintains its uniqueness. Even your passengers have a unique ride because they're sitting high up with a great view of the road. The skylight window in the back is fun to use esp. if you're carrying dogs.

The exterior is streamlined and attractive! (to me anyway). It drives smooth, and accelerates well for a box, you have to push it to higher RPM's to really zoom, but the power is there if you need it. The shifter looks like it's in a weird spot, but it really isn't if you think about it, Honda just opted for a shorter stick and a subwoofer.The sound system is amazing, you can alter your heartbeat with the bass if that's your thing. The doors don't bother me, but I'm not moving kids around. Overall a great dead useful vehicle.

He is very comfortable whether riding or driving. We've taken several vacations in our Element too. Great gas mileage, fun to drive. I love how the back seats lay all the way flat, fold to the side or come completly out to create more cargo space. And when youre riding in the back the seats actually sit higher than the driver so you can see out & over the people in the front. My dog is a taxi for my two Boxers and they love to go for rides.

I got the Nighthawk Black Pearl w/ black tinted windows, giving it a very sleek, head-turning appearance. They finally fixed the grey-paneled look that has kept me from fully appreciating the exterior. It rides firm, but sporty while still feeling as tight as a vault. The engine noise is not a concern at all. Acceleration is fine, since I just like to cruise in it. I already used its immense hauling capabilities each of the first 3 days I had it!

Review:  I've been a long time loyal Honda owner since I was 16. (Now 34 and 6 new Hondas later...) Initially I was a bit skeptical about buying this car. After months and months of research, asking questions, test drives I bit the bullet and bought one on 1/8/07. I've had it for almost 4 months and 3800 miles later, I must say this SUV exceeded my initial expectations! I've driven in several bad snow/ice storms and this SUV just keeps goin' while the other cars and trucks are stranded on the side. (The real-time all wheel drive works wonders!) To make a long story short, if you're considering an Element, go out there and drive it, you'll definitely be impressed!!!

Title: Great, great vehicle!
Review:  We just bought our 2007 Element a few weeks ago, and we already can't get enough of it.  My wife and I wanted something different, and we are now the envy of all of our friends.  No one can believe how roomy it is.  There is plenty of room for your gadgetry and other 'stuff.'  The back seat has plenty of leg room for your guests.  Would definitely recommend for anyone that is looking to 'wow' their friends and family!  LOVE the in dash XM Satellite Radio - I don't know how we lived w/o it  before buying this car.  All of this cool stuff - AND Honda quality!  Overall grade is A+.

Review:  I traded my 2004 Element for a 2007.  I was surprised at how much better the 2007 edition is.  It is a nicer and safer vehicle to drive.  Even with the opportunity to get a different vehicle, the decision was easy to buy another Element.  The 2004 was great.  It's amazing the things I hauled in that vehicle:  a refrigerator, 40 bags of mulch, two love seats...each time with the rear hatch closed.

Title: 2007 Honda Element
Review:  I have driven the Element in snow, off- road and on highways.  The vehicle seems to be at home wherever I go.  I am getting about 21 miles to the gallon in around town and highway mix driving. The interior is functional and is exactly what I wanted.  It allows for quick changes from passenger vehicle to cargo carrier to wet dog carrier.  The radio is outstanding and the controls on the steering wheel make driving and changing stations much easier.  Overall I would rate this as an outstanding vehicle for someone who is between getting a truck or a van and doesn't need seating for 5+.

Review:  I just purchased my 2007 Element a couple of weeks ago, and I love it!  It's great for my two german shepherd dogs!  The back seats flip up out of the way easily and the utility floor is easy to clean.  It's fun to drive, and handles well.  The interior is very spacious, with plenty of leg room for everyone.  The steering wheel mounted audio and cruise controls are easy to use.  And the XM radio is great!  The tailgate configuration in the back makes loading dogs or groceries easy.  So far, I'm averaging 24-25 mpg for a combination of city and highway driving.  Overall, I love it.  It's a great, practical vehicle that's fun to drive!

Review:  What a great little car! I can fit my mountain bikes, snowboards, backpacking equipment and the kitchen sink if I needed to in this awesome car.  If you are a person who loves the outdoors,  this car will DEFINITELY love you too.  If you are a little bit messy - muddy or spill- prone like I am, just hose out the inside and get on with your life.  No tent?  That's fine.  Just recline all the seats and sleep under the moon roof with the doors wide open.  I love how the doors swing wide open so that you can put whatever you need to in the back seat without shutting your front door and opening your back door.  Oh - and it makes a great changing room on cold snowboarding days, too!

It's a comfortable, roomy and reliable multi- purpose vehicle that sells for about $22K with AWD. People are afraid of the quirky style but they are missing out on a fun and practical vehicle.

From problems with the trothle, seats breaking apart, cluster malfunctions, brake issues, suspension problems. Engine failure. Seems this honda was a big mistake. Bought it with almost 100k, after investing more than 2k fixing problems, this car is the worst car i've had in 19 years driving. It keeps falling apart even using original parts.

Title: Reliable as the sun
Review:  Only complaints are the 4-speed auto being unable to really use the powerband as effectively as the 5AT or 5MT, and the drivers seat eventually makes my back sore after a few hours.Otherwise, everything is great. 155,000+ in it with absolutely no failures. Only needs routine maintenance, which is easy to do, with exception of oil dripping on the AWD components when changing the filter (but there’s a part available to help this).Starts the first time, every time. Goes through snow and dirt as easily as pavement. Ours has been to Burning Man five times, no issues with heavy dust exposure. Rear seats come out, and anyone 6’1” or under can sleep in the back, no problem. Rear sunroof is removable, and can be popped for great airflow. Dog loves the waterproof rear seats, and is easy to load up, since it’s easy to step into.It does 95% of anything you need it to do, and you can trust the Element to get it done.

Countless times I have used the suicide doors to get the kids out and people come up to my car to check it out. It's a 2003!!! Don't act like you've never seen one. With two kids under 10 the rubber floors have been a Godsend! I can't tell you how many ice creams and food disasters have been avoided.

Title: Utili-toaster
Review:  At its heart, the Element is exactly what a small SUV should be- practical, reliable, and easy to drive. What sets the car apart is simply how over-the-top utilitarian it really is. The interior is nearly indestructible. The rubberized floors are easy to clean, the seats are waterproof, and the folding rear seats open up a cavernous cargo area that will easily accommodate mountain bikes with the wheels still attached. For a giant rolling box, it handles surprisingly well- though not a sports car, the car feels stable and relatively nimble on mountain roads. An excellent buy for dog owners, college students, or anybody with an active lifestyle.

Title: One of the best cars (trucks?) ever!
Review:  Honda has a talent for making unique niche vehicles.  The CRX, the del Sol, and now the Element have provided great combination of ability, quirkiness, and practicality that could not be matched.  Even though there are many imitators today, none match the utility, configurability, comfort, and handling of the Element.  I can roll (with a ramp!) a 5-foot long, 3-foot tall, almost four-foot wide cart right into the back of the Element.  Or carry three passengers in style and comfort.  Or sleep in the back comfortably.  More headroom and legroom (in front AND back) than anything else I've been in.  All kinds of nifty little storage areas.  Handles much more nimbly and stably than seems possible.

Review:  I put probably 32,000 miles on my Honda in two years. I never had any problems with it. It did make a weird noise when I turned really sharp, it was not a big deal. I bought the car with about 95,000 mile on it and it did that when I bought it. The dealership said it was because of the AWD. I drove a different one a year later and it did not do that. Besides oil changes, I only spent 350.00 on it the entire time I owned it. That was for breaks and its 100,000 mile maintenance. I thought it would need a new belt, but it has a timing chain that last 300,000 miles! We really used this car for what it can be used for. Camping, hauling, animals, etc. The seats are very durable!

Review:  My husband recently totaled our Element. He swerved to miss a deer at 60MPH, spun out on the road berm, and the car rolled down the highway, landed on its wheels, then smashed into the ditch/hillside. The only part of the car that was not mutilated was the back hatch door. The car was smashed beyond recognition. My husband was uninjured except for a goose-egg on his forehead since the drivers airbag did not go off. This vehicle held together so well that even if it held 4 people, all would most likely have been unharmed, except from flying glass. ALL this and the engine would still run. I would totally buy another Element, and plan to as soon as possible! This car is amazing!

Loved being able to sleep in it on road trips with all seats left in/just reclined (just put mesh fabric over windows with magnets to  hold fabric in place.) Super dependable in the rain and snow.  Excellent turning radius.  Doors became problematic when I had two toddlers and had to park next to other cars at the grocery store and get them in and out.  I had to replace 4 or 5 windshields because rocks caused cracks (I think it must be a design flaw.)  Honda did cover the first one when we could not find a rock pock at the crack start.

Review:  I have a 2003 AWD Element, bought new in '03. In my rural real estate practice, I go absolutely everywhere, and in all kind of conditions. (The Pittsburgh end of Pennsylvania is very hilly!).  I have taken it through farmer fields in knee-to-waist-high grass and weeds in showing land. I also have five years experience in all kinds of winter weather, often driving on ice and up to ten inches or so of snow. (The experiences I could tell you!).  I usually use an aggressive tread all- weather tire in the winter, or sometimes a mud & snow. I don't particularly overload my Element with heavy "stuff" in the rear, although I do keep lots of real estate stuff back there (for fixing "for sale" signs).

I really love the waterproof seats and rubber floors. I get sand, mud and water in the car all the time from all the outdoor sports that I do. It's super easy to clean the car and not worry about the mess. I also love the versatility of seating, and cargo space. It's so easy to throw anything I want in the car.

And like all good Mexicans, you can get at least 6 adults in it - not comfortably - but none the least useful to the culture! Whenever I have it maintenanced here in Mexico, everyone at the dealership has to get inside and check it out and so do the customers - it's definitely a head turner. I had a front end accident and the Element barely had a dent while the other Nissan pickup looked like a Mack truck had hit it. Even in Mexico, Honda dealerships provide excellent service!

But I don't mind that negative image because I was more concerned about the space and style versatility of the car. After driving this for 5 years now, I realized that I hate this car at all. I drove Nissan, Toyota, Porsche, Dodge, Chevy, Mazda and I realized the difference. There are far more better cars out there than Honda. I give credit to the reliability of this company but because of this prestige they had, they were too overconfident about their market and they made less effort of better design and worth your money to buy their car.

Review:  Versatility and reliable powertrain are biggest attributes of this EX model AWD vehicle. Removing the rear seats turns it into a cargo van. No carpeting a plus, cleans up easily with vacuum and a wet sponge. Won't win races, but it wasn't designed for that purpose. A few defects, but were covered under warranty. 21 mpg mixed highway and city miles not great, but no surprise due to curb weight, AWD, and lack of aerodynamics. Tight turning radius is impressive. Stress on front "A" pillars may have resulted in windshield cracking. Hard to believe this vehicle is shorter bumper- to-bumper than the Civic in the same model year.

The Honda Element has been a wonderful vehicle to drive for the last 4 years. My son is an avid baseball player and, with dirt and mud and cleats and baseball bags, having this vehicle has been a real blessing. He can have his buds ride with us anywhere and we do not have to worry about dirty carpet or spills that may happen. Just wipe it down with cleaner and it is good as new. I love it!  It drives so easy and is very comfortable on long trips. My son also loves the fact the seats recline so he can rest before games.

Title: Excellent alternative to an all-out-SUV
Review:  I've had my E for about 2.5 years now and haven't had any problems worth taking to the dealer for. The drivers seat needs new bushings to keep it from shifting, and every 10 minutes or so, the headlights go dim for a second before returning to normal. Both of these items are inherent to the 2003 model. The cabin does have some wind noise, and the suspension is rather jarring. Otherwise, this vehicle has been 100% reliable. It has a very tight turning circle, and is very fun to drive. The lack of carpeting makes for easy cleaning and the seat configurations make it one of the most versatile vehicles on the road. I usually get 21 MPG on average. Wish Honda made an upscale version.

Review:  There is no better car if you, like I, need to haul furniture or just more than you intended to buy at Costco. I have had the car for four years and almost 60,000 miles, and there have been no major repairs needed. As a result, this Element has cost far less to own and maintain than I ever expected.  Although some people dislike the way the back doors open, it is a real advantage when you are trying to reach items or move bulky furniture in or out. On occasion, I have removed the back seats and used the element as a small van when moving our adult children to college or a new apartment.  There is almost as much room as a small UHaul.   In short, I am very satisfied with this car.

Review:  Love my Honda Element and would buy another one but am waiting for them to do another design so it doesn't look just like the one I am driving now which is a 2003.  I like the green of the 2003 but not the 2007 green.

Title: It doesn't get better
Review:  With my very high mileage driving at mostly high speeds on all sorts of road conditions, I can truthfully say that the Element is the most pleasurable vehicle of the more than 20 I have owned. At close to 100,000 miles, I am not pleased that the struts must be replaced at extremely high cost. Other than that, I recommend this vehicle to family, friends, neighbors and strangers every chance I get.

Title: I am in my Element
Review:  I bought someone's deal gone bad so I got some toys I might not have added to the vehicle, but I am glad I have them now.  It is fun to drive.  The manual shift lever is very handy (short throw)-  positioned like a sports car.  I love being high off the road and everyone is AMAZED at the room inside it.  I use it for moving around displays and large boxes in my business.

Title: Love my Element!!
Review:  I am 47 years old and have always seen cars as simply a way to get places. I have never actually "loved" a car before. I love my Element!!  I love the outdoors and lugging my kayak around is never a problem for me now. The seats are so versatile: I moved my daughter to and from college 3 years running by removing the back seats and loading it up- and you know how much girls bring to college!  It is easy to get my elderly parents (both are 81) in and out. It is fun to drive; I have the 5 speed and love the location of the stick. I had one of the first ones in my area and was stopped on the street many times to tell people about my car.  It is easy to clean as no carpets!  I love my Element!!!

Title: Honda Element is a great family, fun car
Review:  Love this vehicle and would buy another.  With no carpeting, tons of space, and fold up seats, we can  fit the kids and all their stuff, or appliances.  Gas mileage is okay - around 21 in the city and I drive 100 miles a day.  It's real comfortable on long trips, though I wish a passenger front armrest was standard.  MP3 compatible, and outlets everywhere.  And the best is no carpet to get smelly from wet or dirty shoes; just vacuum it out, and we're ready to go.  Truly fun to drive, though the back seats sit up high and adults usually think it's weird; but I love it!  Already looking to see what the new ones have, and might trade it in for another.  Great family vehicle.

The dogs love it (Mr. 40# & Ms. 80#)  Excellent quality and flat out fun.  Holds 4 adults with respective golf clubs and room for two more sets of clubs.  The 80 plus mother's fit too!

Title: Driving in HD!
Review:  When I first took a test drive I immediatly fell in love. I was always afraid of driving suvs. I always drove compact vehicles but was tired of asking people to help me get and move stuff. Now with 2 large dogs, I had to bite the bullet and nothing seemed realistic to me, and I always thought the element looked cool. Umm, the turning radius on this is sick. No need to do a 3 point turn, just turn! It is like driving in high def, I feel like its a movie. Such a great car, no need to speed because you enjoy driving so much, and usually I hate being the one to drive but now I love it.

Title: Quite the SUV!
Review:  It is a pleasure to drive. It has excellent control, decent acceleration for an SUV, and a turning radius that can get you through any tight parking situation or do a fast three point turn. The only problem is that the wind can often blow the car off course during highway driving. This is rather dangerous and you therefore have to keep your speeds way down on windy days. It is due to the car's aerodynamic (or lack of one) design and therefore most likely unfixable in later models.

Title: Beware the RUST!!!
Review:  I bought a super clean low mileage Element in Detroit in late 2005.  The vehicle has only 14K miles and still well under the 3yr/36K Honda warranty.  The car had surface rust on fixtures and bracket, esp in the engine area.  Honda refuses to take resp. and fix this obvious design flaw.  So don't buy a Honda anywhere where there is road salt because you may well be sorry!  I've been slowly fixing the rust at my expense and time.

Title: RIP the "great pumpkin"
Review:  I had a wonderful time with my orange 2003 Element.  The combination of reasonable fuel economy (for an SUV), a large amount of carrying space and versatility made for a great experience.  Great for passengers and cargo alike.  I'm really going to miss putting my bikes and kayak in the back of it.  Unfortunately, I had to say goodbye to it as I recently experienced a rollover accident, and the car is totaled.  **It held up very well under the circumstances**.  The car did a complete rollover and landed on its tires.  I was lucky, plus wearing a seatbelt, and walked away without injury.

Title: Where Is Honda Quality
Review:  This is the 3rd Honda we owned, but we have big reservations about this one.  The fit and finish is not so Honda- like. Many of dashboard panels rattle after the first year-maybe caused by the Honda installed alarm system? The plastic cover over the rear seat hinges keeps on coming lose. The worst of all, is the wind-shield. It cracked twice without any reason. The first time while I was driving it. Sounded like a stone landed on it when there were no car of truck in front of me. The dealer insisted that it was caused by a rock, and not a defect! But then it happend again 3 months later. Now I drive around with a cracked windshield that I wouldn't fix, and I am telling everybody about it.

Title: Elemental
Review:  Great car, or BOX as it were. We use it for a dog/camping/hauling car and its utility body serves us well. This is a replacement for a '87 Real Time Civic wagon which has 212k on it. Still commute with it, but getting tired. The famous and deserved Honda reliabilty is definitely there in the Element. TONS of interior room even for very tall people. Handles just like you'd expect it to looking at it (NOT a "sporty" drive). 4 wheel disc brakes are great, 4 cyl. IV-Tech is a bit small for this vehicle (perfect for the Civic SI!). Works hard to maintain highway speed on long grades out here in the West. Not dog friendly as Fido can't see out. Suicide doors make getting out clumsy in parking lot

Review:  I love my Element as it is the most versatile, practical vehicle I have ever owned.  I can move the seats around and haul most anything.  It is easy to clean since it has no carpeting.  The all wheel drive has been most useful this year since we have had more snow and ice than usual.  It gets great mileage for an SUV (about 22 mpg around town and 25 on the interstate) and I feel very safe in it.  I will buy another Element, but next time I will get the side air bags.

Review:  We purchased the Element AWD as a replacement for an Explorer. We have had no regrets, as we can now carry far more cargo, as we have more room. We were pleased with the interior as we have dogs that travel with us and it is very easy to clean. The fuel mileage is as advertised, and not blown out of proportion. Most of our driving is highway/interstate speeds between our homes in Fla. and the mountians of N. Georgia, and have never had a problem maintaining speed in the mountains, even while towing a small trailer with ATV.

Title: Never believe how amazing this box is!!!
Review:  Most amazing car ever. Im 50 and I fit perfectly. Best Friend is 66 and drives his in comfort, too! I'm a mountain biker and I just throw my bike in the back, covered in mud, dripping with slime. Let the mud dry, sweep it out, and wipe with damp rage. Voila, like new. I can fit 2 mtn. bikes in the back by just folding up the seats, without removing any tires! I have a German Shepherd and the fur monster loves it, and I love sweeping out the dog fur. No more hours with an upholstery brush to get fur out. Perfect moonroof-Fold down the seats and gaze up at the stars while you doze off in full length comfort. Its ugly, but I get envious looks when I fit a queen set in the back, no sweat.

Review:  1st 95 went over 300k before being totalled by a truck running a red light. Walked away with no injuries. 2nd 95 le supercharged going strong at 155k. Just routine maintenance.  Bought a 96 dx with 68 k, like new on inside. Middle bench removes in 2 minutes, easy to haul things. 95s had the great swiveling middle captain chairs.  Could not resist a 1 owner 97 sc alltrac LE with 80k that I spotted on craigslist, talk about awesome in the snow!  These are fantastic, reliable vans and the best used van value ever.  Use as an enclosed pickup, or convert to a mini RV, loads of space inside.  Easy to fix minor quirks like higher mileage valve cover gasket leaks, coolant reservoir outlet tube obstruction by debris, SADS bushing replacement, etc.

Build quality is unbelievable (it's a Toyota, stupid), handling is exemplary with the mid- engine and AWD.  Fuel mileage is 19 mpg around town, with up to 24 on the highway.  I'm a Toyota salesman, and I sold this van new to an engineer and bought it from the family after he passed away. I constantly am amazed with the number of people who ask me if I want to sell it.

Review:  My 1997 AWD Previa is the third one that I have owned. I previously had a 1991 and a 1994. All three have been completely trouble free, for a total of over 620K mi. The supercharger gives the 2.4 litre engine the punch of a V6, while delivering great gas mileage. I've been searching for a replacement for 5 years, but nothing made these days even comes close. The Sienna is too long, fat, low and is just not as much fun. If Toyota ever made a reasonable replacement for the Previa, I would buy it in an instance.

Review:  An amazing vehicle: mid-engine, supercharged, all-wheel drive, 7-passenger with plenty of room, yet 2 inches shorter than the Camry! This was our 2nd Previa.  The first was a 1992 LE AWD.  We bought that one with ~37k mi, sold it with ~150k mi, and last I knew, it now has over 220k on it.  I bought my '97 with 50k mi and it now has 164k.  It has been VERY reliable (as was the '92) and I would buy another if they still sold them.  The Sienna is nice, but it is longer, lower, and the AWD model has those stupid/expensive run-flat tires.

Title: I'll drive this car until they take it away from m
Review:  Bought this Avy in 2007 used with 1200 miles on it.  A limo operator had it but traded it for two Lincoln Town Cars!  I traveled for work and put 125k on it in three years without a single problem.  Car now has 150k on it and it's as strong and comfy as ever.  Had to put 1k in it three years ago but that's the only repair besides tires and brakes in all this time and mileage.  Car rides smooth and quiet all day at 80 mph these days just as it did when I bought it.  Now and then I think about getting something newer but then I take the Avy to the car wash and get it shined up and cleaned inside and I'm good for another year.  This is, without a doubt, the best car I've ever owned in my 71 years.  Well, to tell the truth, it's really tied with a 1997 Camry we have that has 125k on it.  It, too, runs like a sewing machine.

Vehicle: 2007 Toyota Avalon Sedan Touring 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 5A)
Title: 280K MIles and Very Relieable
Review:  I have owned a 2007 Touring model for 3 years.  I purchased with 180K miles after my Lexus LS430 was totaled.  I looked at a number of Avalons but did not want to spend over $10K for a lower mileage one because I drive over 30K miles per year.  I bought this specific car thinking that I might drive it for a year while I looked for another LS430.  I love the handling and comfort of this car. It does not ride as soft as the LS but it easier to drive because it just soaks up the miles without much steering correction.  I tried the Limited model first but found the cooled seats were not as comfortable as those without this feature.  I specifically looked for a model that did NOT have the sunroof as this feature limits headroom (I'm 6'2") and need the extra 3" or so that models without the sunroom have.  I have put a new battery and brakes on this car.  Those have been the only repairs in 100K miles.  No check engine lights.  No weird noises.  Great acceleration.  This is a roomy car with a huge back seat.  It's not fair to compare with the LS 430 that costs twice as much but there are some areas that seem to not be as nice-like the trunk carpet and trim.  Overall, this has been a great used car for us-I would purchase again and recommend to anyone looking for a large dependable sedan.  Because everyone wants an SUV these tend to be lower priced on the used market (compared to SUV's) and make a great buy for people looking for reasonable transportation.

Review:  Where to begin.. I'm just a joe who likes to save money so forgive me for my rant. and stop reading if you are part of the buy a car for 20,000 and pay everyone to fix it then sell it when your tired of it and buy a whole new car... If that's you... Then STOP reading this. You will be offended. Toyota makes great engines and has a history of great engines, but they(and most other car companies) have made their vehicles non user friendly. And simple parts and accessories have lost their quality.What do I mean? I mean I believe toyota is going backwards from the original beauty of their older predecessors.its sad. Take my 2000 Camry with a 4cyl. All the hoses are thick and heavy duty. Made to last!every clamp and air hose is easily accessible. The 2007 Avalon however has leaks in the brake lines,coolant lines,power steering line, and windshield washer line, and it only has 140k miles!so replace all those lines. Then remove all the engine paraphernalia and look at your engine, then take your bumper off and replace your light bulbs.... See what I'm getting at.. Heck supposedly the newest cars are going to require the entire cab to be removed for an oil change!They want your money at the factory.. They don't want you doing your engine work.. Or the mechanic.. They want to narrow it down to your money and the Toyota factory. Forget aftermarket and quick fixes and good engines that last a million miles in the 70s they have you buying a new car every 300,000 miles and all the in between fixens. Thanks for your time and be grateful for your old beater!btw great car other than being a possible money pit... Handles well and is comfy and pretty.

View out of the rear window can be quite tricky while backing up, but the car's blind spot isn't too bad. However I would not recommend for snow driving. Only 2 inches here, and very slippery on roads. Overall I love my Avalon, and it's a very comfy ride!

IT IS NOT RELIABLE. The cylinder coils fail and fail regularly until you need new cylinders which sadly happen at less than 100k. Toyota should step up and recall these engines for failure, instead of touting the wondrous American-like sedan. Buyer Beware.

Title: 2007 Avalon XLS
Review:  The drive quality is great, except for the rear visibility when backing out of a parking space. Tire noise is a major problem if you buy a low quality tire like Good Year. Engine noise is no problem, I think other people think the noise is from the engine, when it is actually the tires. Paint is very thin and of poor quality. Just make sure you keep it waxed regularly. I have 45,000 miles so far with no problem. Oil is changed on time with synthetic and rubber is lubed with 303.

Title: Yota
Review:  Bought this car because of the Consumer Reports ratings on reliability and its reasonable price for a Lexus-like ride. It has been a pretty good car. I've felt the transmission hunt when rapidly accelerating (like 1000's of others) but it has not cause a problem.  Hood paint is marginal. Gas mileage exceptional. Comfortable interior. Would definitely buy another but would look at the Nissan/Infinity models also due to the transmission slip issue.

Review:  We purchased a 2007 Avalon new in the spring of 2007. This was our first Toyota. It was a great car. The back seat had a limousine feel to it. Got great gas mileage. Never had a problem with it. Because of the safety issue with the accelerator we sold it. I would definitely buy another Toyota but will wait until the dust settles.

Title: steaming pile
Review:  This is the most disappointing car I've ever owned. Although it's comfortable, quiet, roomy and has a great stereo, it's had 3 recalls. Other than the notorious gas pedal problem, it also has a recall on a defective oil supply line going to the valves. If this bursts like mine did you may very well destroy your engine and the only warning you will get is the sound of your engine seizing up! The transmission is jerky but no recall for that yet. If you already own one of these cars, call your dealer NOW and tell them you want the oil supply line replaced at once (for free) or you'll be very sorry. They will not warn you about this problem ahead of time by sending you a letter so call today.

AC hose clogged at 35k miles, soaked & ruined the carpeting; oil line broke (28k miles) and I lost all engine oil on the road.  Added oil to limp into the dealership.

Title: A few things stink
Review:  The gps system is effectively inoperative.  You can't get the enter key to hit a letter or other item with any sort of reliability.  Entering a street name could take twenty minutes.  The dealer here in Newark De, said that this is typical and fixing would cost a small fortune.  So I use a $150 garmin. Pathetic, don't you think?  I have about 50k miles on the car.  Also, the seat heaters stay on all the time, so I had to disconnect the fuses, so I lost that function.  I am a little disappointed in the car for these reasons.  Other than that, it has a beautiful ride with excellent mileage.  My next car will not be an Avalon - I may go to a Buick or a Lexus.

The AC was broken, O2 sensor, gas tank and a list of other items brought the repair bill to $4500. If it were not for CA emissions warranty, I'd have to pay the entire thing.

Review:  Talked to some Avalon owners before making purchase.  Have had the car for two years putting 15k on per year.  Overall, we are pleased.  It has great design, size, ride, performance and comfort expected.  Replaced the OEM Michelin tires at about 27K with some Yokahama.  The OEM still had tread, but not enough for winter driving.   Problem to date is what appears to be a "gap", missing bushing or poorly fitting parts somewhere in the steering assembly. After stopping, there is a slight drop in the steering wheel of about 1/8 inch with a little "klunk" when we start again. Dealer replaced steering assemble shaft, but problem still exists. Having hard time replicating when we take it in.

It has a very loud noise in the engine. I have taken it in too many times only to be told by the mechanic that he does not hear the noise. These guys must be deaf!!! The last mechanic told me that the noise is normal that the sound was in other cars he tested?! Transmission horrible to say the least not smooth at all. Sound system cannot be heard over noisy engine, brakes are terrible, problem with wipers, in all one of the worse vehicles I have ever owned. I can't wait to get rid of it!!!!!!

I don't agree with the raps on the seat comfort: I'm pretty big and it's fine.  Handles great. Have had many of the minor problems reported by others:  Tranny shifting improved by TSB re-calib.

I'm not looking forward to the paint in another couple of years.  We get 32 on the freeway and in the low 20s in town when my wife drives... not so much with me driving. The tranny feels a little weird at times (almost like it's slipping), but I guess that's just the way its made.  We've have no problems with it.  I had the factory wheels chromed for about $400.

The Avalon has a limo like back seat which makes taking guest out with you a very flattering event as well as the pleasure and comfort of the ride.  I use this car for both long business trips (300 mi+) and local.  The mileage has been good for a bigger six (24 mpg avg).  The ability for this car to get up and go is amazing. The manual shift mode is exciting with almost 300 ponies under the hood but yet refined enough for the wifes finest dress and black tie night out.

Review:  This vehicle rides nice on a smooth road, however on a rough road with ruts, it follows the ruts and somewhere there is a rattle that is intermittent. If the wind is blowing, it wants to blow off the road with the wind.  Sometimes I feel like a bobble head doll.  The headliner is not flush with the back window and they have tried to fix it twice but now say it is in tolorance of their complaints.  Paint is so soft, you cannot wash it without spider web scratches.  Window wipers are so flimsy they leave streaks on the window right in the sight range and it is very distracting.  Service rep said to use Rain X to have clean windshield.

Over the 15 months that I had it, it was in the shop twice for rattles, and twice to have the oxygen sensor issue fixed, for a total of about 7 or 8 days without the car, most was related to the sensors. It had another annoying rattle in the dash when I got rid of it.   These may have all started after I had XM added to the car, but that doesn't make the rattles go away.   I traded it in for a non-Toyota vehicle after 6500 miles.

Review:  I've had the XL model since Aug. '07 and have about 6500K ultra-enjoyable miles on it. I've had two Beemers and an Infinity, also enjoyed them very much, but the Avalon is special in that it's smooth, quiet, fairly ecnomical on gas, considering its size. I use regular octane -- also Plus and Premium at times. I also have found the cloth/velour seats to be very practical -- warm on cold days, cool on hot ones. Transmission-wise, it just knows when to shift for you -- it's really a symbiotic relationship between car and driver, to use that analogy. The driver's seat needs more back support, though. So, I'll rate this car as a 9-1/2 -- ALMOST PERFECT -- but then again, nothing's perfect

But even more annoying is that your passengers cannot program the nav system while the car is in motion.  Driving down the road with my wife we decide we want to get something to eat. Toyota makes you pull to the side of the freeway and stop (endangering life and property) and then do your navigation.  By the time you work this out you can drive through most towns and find a place to eat without the navigation system.   The lack of an aux input for the stereo system in this day and age is just plain dumb.

To think I have a car which will get to 60 in under 7 secs, get mid 20's mileage in all round driving, and near 30mpg on the highway, all on regular gas is truly remarkable. Stereo and adaptive cruise control are great but I am disappointed that the memory seat feature doesn't adjust the steering wheel and main rear view mirror like cars in this price range should. Here in North Florida I recommend the extra window tint and the optional rear window screen.I haven't ridden in that fabulous rear seat but my guests have commented that the comfort rivals limos they've ridden.

Dealership says that is normal??  I just hope that it does not finally fail while I am on a long trip 2000 miles from home.  I enjoy driving the car but would feel much more at ease if the engine were not so noisy and the transmission shifted smoother.  The rear vision from the car when backing is also very limited.

It is a more refined car than the Chrysler and very enjoyable to drive. It is quiet, quick, roomy and has a very nice ride without sacrificing handling.  I had read complaints about the harsh ride on the Touring edition, but I disagree. It definitely rides better than my 300 did.  I got just over 31mpg on the road on the trip to the Smokies   which gives you a cruising range of around 550 miles!

It also came standard with 6-way power seats on the passenger side, which you can't get in the Avalon. The wheel well is so tight you scrape your hands trying to clean them. The paint coat is so thin on the front it chips real easy, didn't have this problem with the Lincoln. I was getting 20/26 MPG with the Towncar and only get 2 MPG more with my Toyota. May go back to a Ford Product the next time. The joy stick on the navigation system is time consuming.

Using synthetic oil I can get 33 mpg on flat interstate. Around the mountains I average 24-28 mpg. I convinced my dealer to put some extra padding in the drivers seat and the service manager only did this because the leather had a crease in it. They refused to fix the passenger seat, so it's like sitting on a block of wood, well maybe not that bad but compared to other seats it's pretty bad. I am going for a Lexus ES 350 next time.

Review:  The seats in this Avalon are terrible, more uncomfortable than you can imagine. Why would a designer put all kinds of seams in a car seat? The steering is also "hard", not smooth like in our 2003 Avalon. It feels like I'm driving a Mack truck. The radio sounds like an old transistor AM radio - tinny and poor quality. I've also had major problems with merging onto interstates from entrance ramps; sometimes I wonder if I'll make it without being rear ended by a car 1/4 mile behind me. The pick-up is not reliable. Cabin noise is very loud on interstates, mostly from moonroof. Overall, if you are a small woman who is looking for comfort and a great car for road trips, the 2007 Avalon is not it.

Title: Great Car
Review:  Just about everything about this car is great, at the price paid it should be. It does have a few shortcomings, the trunk lid closes like a piece of tin. The dealer said nothing can be done about it and the back bumper where it fits along the side is a poor fit. Overall the car is joy to drive.

Title: Beautiful Automobile
Review:  This is the second Avalon that I've owned, and the 2007 is much nicer than the 2004 I traded. Test drove Volvo S80, Saab 9-5 and Lexus ES 350. The Avalon, while not having the panache of the other brands, is by far the best value for the money. Beautiful interior, contemporary exterior and the powertrain is responsive.

Title: Excellent car for the price
Review:  I had a Lexus 2005 ES 330 - not happy at all after 25000 miles, traded to 2006 Honda Accord - ok, finally found Avalon XL 2007, very very happy. Drove 1000 miles so far, I will keep this car at least up to 100,000 miles. Excellent car for the price. This car does not have MP3 cd changer or iPod input which is my strong requirement, however got Harman-Kardon gadget installed that plays iPod. I  strongly suggest to test drive this car before you spend lots of money some place else. I rate this car almost 9.8, very comfortable and really fun to drive compared to my previous two new cars I bought. I drive ~20000 miles in a year and need comfortable car, this will do the job.

Title: Comfortable Car
Review:  The Avalon is a great car to experience driving comfort. The interior is very roomy pleasant to use. Keyless ignition is OK but seems to be an answer to a question no one has asked. Exterior is pleasant but could use more classic car styling such as Chrysler has found such success with. All-in-all a great car!

Title: Luxurious Without Luxury Price Tag
Review:  Just drove 2600 miles on 2 week vacation. Car is great. Was hesitant at first to buy a sedan, because driving positions on SUVs are more comfortable. But after all the miles and all the hours in the car on this trip, I had no back pain or discomfort. Averaged 28 to 29 mpg on highway but I was cruising at 75 mph most of the time. Could have done better at lower speed, but car is so well built that 75 mph feels like 55 mph. Luxury looks, luxury ride and luxury features without the luxury price tag. Very glad I bought this car.

Review:  This is my 3rd Avalon -1995, 2000, 2007. I didn't feel comfortable with the drive by wire acceleration. Two trips to the dealer where they scanned the computer didn't show anything. Finally, on Edmunds forum someone had TSB EG 029-07 regarding the tranny controller. Brought to the dealer with this info. The reprogrammed the controller and this fixed the problem.

Title: Sporty car with a ride to match.
Review:  This was one of the most reliable cars I have ever owned.  Just oil changes and new tires when the originals wore out.  The car handled great and had very good power and stopping ability.  Sadly, it rode pretty rough with its low profile tires. The trunk was miniscule and the rear seat didn't fold down.  Rear visibility was poor at best.  Thankfully it had a rear camera and cross traffic sensors.  The blind spot monitors worked well. Buy it if you don't need much cargo carrying capacity and like a sporty sedan and don't mind a less than ideal ride----a trade-off for the excellent handling.  Good gas mileage.

Title: Not Bad; not great
Review:  Overall our ‘13 Avalon is a compromise  in meeting our expectations for comfort, quasi-sportiness, and initial quality.  Best features include the space for 6’-4” legs and the visibility afforded to urban driving conditions.  Mechanically, the vehicle is Toyota solid.  Power-plant and powertrain deliver almost exhilarating and  smooth performance.  What’s annoying is the mediocre workmanship within the cabin’s interior.  This car is highway driven >80% in Southern California’s vastly fair weather.  Road noise is distractingly noticeable.. Headliner at the top edge of rear window and sewing/anchoring of driver-front leather seat (lowest front edge) have detached themselves. Adhesives or sewing required.  The ride is a tad light - meaning not stout/solid and stable.   Strictly applying  money spent vesus a quality product in return, it would have been worth spending it elsewhere.

Title: Best Avalon yet.
Review:  Traded in a 2008 Avalon for a 2013. Was a little worried when I read some negative reviews, but NONE of those issues turned out to be true for me. The seats are WAY better than my previous 2008. The ride is much sportier, especially in regard to steering and handling. Yes, you get a little more "roadfeel", but I'd rather feel that I have more precise control, which I definitely do with this new model. Motor is essentially the same as my 2008, and I had ZERO issues with that car (owned until 155K miles). Looks way less like a little old man's car, and more modern. Interior is way nicer, and road noise is way less than my 2008. Stereo is a HUGE improvement as well. Technology overall is impressive in the base model, which was not the case with previous Avalon base models.  Great on the highway just like previous models. As far as resale value, nothing beat's Toyotas, especially the Avalon.

Title: My late review
Review:  I know this review is on the late side, i guess better late than never.  When the new design of the Avalon came out in 2013, I thought it was a great improvement than the previous years. I purchased the Limited model in October 2013 and after owning the Avalon for over 3 years, i feel that i can give a better review.  I agree with a lot of the comments about the Avalon, for instance, the seats are NOT comfortable, hard to get in and out of the car due to low roof line, the ride is not very smooth and loud road noise, this is due to the low profile tires.   handling is alright, very sensitive buttons for the climate control and radio,  trunk light is a major joke,  a candle puts out more light. The Avalon is not a car to take a long trip in, its good for around town or a short trip no more than 2 hours.  The performance and reliability have been great.  The gas mileage has been decent.  I guess i accepted the 2013 Avalon to be like my mothers 2007 Avalon, which had a better ride, comfortable seats, easy to get in and out of the car, smooth riding and quiet.  What a difference between the two cars

Title: 2013 Avalon Limited owner
Review:  One of the best vehicles I've ever owned.  We bought a 2013 white Toyota Avalon Limited in 2016 and we are very happy with our purchase.  For the money, the Avalon provides a nice luxurious feel with the refined leather interior and sleek dashboard.  Very smart technology package. The redesigned exterior, and in particular, the rear of the car give it a very fancy and sleek look.  My wife and I are in our late 20's and early 30's range, and we love this car!         CONS: A bit of a rough ride when driving over potholes and uneven/unpaved roads.  The struts and suspension could use some re-engineering for future models.

Title: Best car I have ever had
Review:  I can't believe I'm doing this.  First because I can't believe I'm actually saying it's the "best" car I've ever had, since I've had some really cool cars in my life.  My first was a  new '68 Chevy Nova in High School (Class of '70), then a  '74 Chevelle convertible after college, An AMC Javelin muscle car, 76 Lincoln Continental, 78 Mazda RX 4 with rotary engine, then a 79, RX4 with more luxury features and killer stereo...skip to 2007 after a variety of other cars from Pontiac Grand Am to Chrysler LeBaron Coupe, when it got the big upgrade in 88-89.  But it was the 2007 Acura TL, that held the title for my favorite car until I had to trade it in.  That is when I first saw the 2013 Avalon.  It was superior in every way, from touch panel controls to exterior design, to trunk room that reminds you of the old cartoon with Bugs Bunny, who enters what looks like a tiny tent on the outside, but is palace size inside.  It fooled me as the Audi A7 from the side and the elongated roof line that disguises that deep trunk and big back seat with plenty of leg room for everyone but an NBA star.  Every detail is really, not kidding, just....well...gorgeous!  It has been a long time when I have muttered to myself after returning home from a store run-"I LOVE this car!"  Sorry Lexus, your Star Wars, radically angled, immense, radiator cover design is so ugly to me that I couldn't buy one.  The only thing worse, in my opinion, is anything with the Buick name on it!  Talk about ugly!  They are right about "it sure doesn't look like a Buick!"  From the company that gave us the Riviera, possibly the most beautiful car GM ever made, it sure doesn't look like a Buick-"Oh, My!".   Just a little out of my league in 6th grade to High School Jr.  We never had anything like the Avalon, except in magazines with designs of "CARS OF THE FUTURE".  The Avalon, from front lights to rear lights, interior dashboard and audio, style and quality is superb and the seats are MUCH more comfortable than the Acura. That said, I do have an entirely fused back, from skull to butt, that cars aren't designed for.  Somehow I am able to configure these seats without needing a pillow or other support cushion, that always had to be moved around.  I don't mean to make the Acura sound bad.  It wasn't.  It was a wonderful car.  So beautiful in its sleek, smooth, elegant, lines and legendary reliability-remember it was a 2007, that was still in great shape, until it was totaled by a friend who borrowed it.  That is when I went for a trade in.  At the Dealership I was at, looking for a newer Acura, I turned and saw the Avalon.  WHAT IS THAT? I asked.  He told me it was a Toyota.  It couldn't be.  For some reason I had never seen one of these before, which is strange, because it grabbed my attention immediately.  Which brings us to this "Testimony" of a car review.  Folks, this is NOT our parents Toyota.  At 65, I really do remember the little box-like  Volkswagen Beetles, called TOYotas-Remember?  That's what Toyotas and Datsun's (Nissan) were then.  No more!  Why oh why must it have "toy" in its name.  It doesn't have any word but "Avalon" on it, but the sedate logo is almost invisible because of the truly head turning styling, that I just can't get enough of.  Even the way they craft the rear lights into the lines of the bumper and side panels is just perfect.  I can assure you that I will want to trade this in ONLY on a newer Avalon.  I don't know how I could give a better review than this.  Further, you may look in vain for other car reviews by me from the past, since I have never done one for any company before.  Again, with cars like the first Mazda's with the new rotary engines that were wonderful, to the virtual Navy aircraft carrier, Lincoln Continental, to the Acura, I have never had a car that just has it all- beauty, performance, comfort and cutting edge technology, like the Toyota Avalon.  Hold your noses up high Jaguar or Mercedes owners, this Japanese car will give all of them a run for the money.

Title: Bullet proof long term reliability
Review:  Purchased this car certified used.  I love the interior space, luxury, performance and technology.  I'd expect more from my local dealer (Lustine Toyota in Woodbridge, VA) but the car is worth the hassle and extreme lack of customer service.  I'm surprised at the performance of this big car ... it's really in between a mid and large size sedan at 195" in length.  The acceleration, responsiveness of the engine and transmission is great.  The upgraded stereo in the Limited is nice and it's good to have some bass response for a change from a production car's sound system.  People complain about the ride and when you hit some potholes it can be rough but I prefer a firmer ride and less body roll when cornering.  The brakes I don't find to be spongy I think the pedal just takes a little more effort which I find to be better than brakes that are too responsive (like tapping the brake pedal and it jars you forward).  Very good value and I find it to be an appealing choice to those that like their passengers in the rear to ride in comfort too.

Title: Avalon Definitely Not A Bomb
Review:  This is our third Avalon.  With that being said, it is refreshing to see that 2013 received a lot of design changes on the exterior as well as the interior.  I have to say I like every one of them including the tires and wheels.  We were lucky to find a 2013 with only 16500 miles on it.  I think I got a fair deal, but not what I consider a great deal.  I really like the ride comfort, and the instrumentation on it.  My last Avalon had the 6 disc changer instead of GPS, and it was a limited also.  I would still be driving it if not for some screwball that blasted us from the back on I-40 doing 40 mph while traffic was stopped.  It totaled the car.  I do get 31 on the highway and it rounds out to about 25 mph on highway and city driving.  I really have fallen in love with the Avalon all over again with the new design.  I highly recommend anyone looking for an Avalon to pay a few extra bucks and get it loaded with a limited model.  The car handles well with the Michelin tires, and I'll be giving it a total road trip from North Carolina to Florida shortly.  I can't wait.

Title: Toyota Scores With Epic Retool
Review:  The Avalon is a brilliant piece of machinery.  The aerodynamic lines are perfectly matched to create a breathtaking image.  We bought ours used with only about 16.5k miles on her.  From the  moment I laid eyes on it, I knew I had to have it.  The interior is a spaceship like masterpiece.  The touch sensitive buttons make life so much easier and less likely to break.  The heated/ventilated front seats are also a pleasure to use.  On the exterior, one of the impressive things is the LED running lights.  The rear LED tail lights is also a great addition to this body style.  I would have to say that I enjoy driving this Avalon Limited quite a bit more than the previous 3 Limited's I've owned.  Granted, it's handling and steering is much stiffer,  but i prefer to feel the road.  The seats are fine, a little stiff, but they hld up well, and are universally adjustable.  Overall, I would say if you can find a used 2013 with low mileage, it's a no brainer.  Buy it.

I finally placed three paper clip clamps on the edge which have kept them in place. The back to one of the front seats detached and would not reattach. The dealership replaced both backs to the front seats as a factory defect at no cost to me. The plastic frame around the edge of the front passenger seat has now detached and will not reattach. I plan to again see if the dealer will help me on this issue. This 2013 Avalon now has a little over 18,000 miles. I shutter to think what shape these seats will be in at 180,000 miles.

We take a 400 miletrip about once a month.On the first trip in Feb 13 I noticed at the 100 mile mark that I couldn't get comfortable in the seats - felt hard.I didn't say anything, but the next month my wife(its her car) said these seats aren't comfortable.She said the other day I want a new car - one that has comfortable seats and softer tires.

Title: Won over
Review:  I bought the Avalon Touring XLE model in March 2013. Initially, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the ride. I thought there was too much road feel.This October, I drove it to Ohio and Indiana from Florida. It performed amazingly andI am now smitten with this machine.I really enjoy driving it and on a smooth road, it is terrific.I am averaging nearly 30 mpg . My driving is all at 60mph where I live . No regrets on this purchase.Update 2016 : I love this car. I looked at the new models that came out this year and I think the 2013 looks better.Update 2018: This car still  impresses me. Most of my driving is at 60 mph. In a rural area with a 30 mile drive to a grocery, this is a pleasure to drive.  The appearance is great and I am still getting compliments from passengers about rear legroom, comfort etc. Currently at  34000 miles on odometer. Plan to keep this for a long time.

Review:   I have been a happy Toyota customer all my adult life (now 55 and had only one non-toyota).I am very frustrated with this car.I suppose if one has low expectations, then this is the car for you..I feel like a sucker for purchasing it..I feel like I have a 'super Corolla',... not at all the car I wanted to give my wife.We purchased this car for long rides, and I only see this being acceptable for around town.Toyota has taught me a lesson I will not forget.It seems to me that Toyota has left the upscale market, and is leaving that for Lexus' territory.Seriously, I'm not being too harsh.Check it out for yourself.

Title: What was Toyota thinking with the the Suspension on 2013 Avalon? 
Review:  I am a previous Avalon owner of two Avalon's. They were good cars. Now I own a 2013 Avalon. The ride is very harsh with bumps being transmitted into the cabin as noticeable knocks. Road noise is terrible on worn asphalts and concrete roads. The head lights cut off to soon on low beam. The seats are very hard making a long trip unpleasant. I now wish that I had not purchased this car.

Title: Premium Car Price Without Premium Ride, Quietness or Seat Comfort
Review:  2013 Avalon does not not feel like a $35,000 premium sedan. The ride is busy because even small road imperfections are felt and heard.There's no sound insulation under the carpets or in the doors so the road noise level is high like being in a Corolla. The front seat bottoms are small in size and thinly padded.So my seat bottom gets sore after only 20 miles of highway driving.The only "premium" car qualities that the 2013 Avalon has are rock solid directional stability on the highway, a smooth, quiet and responsive engine and transmission, and a fairly luxurious looking and feeling interior.

Title: Beware of buying the 2013 Avalon Limited
Review:  I've owned this car for less than a week and have 2 problems with it, the back of the driver side seat panel broke and the headliner is falling down. The sad part of this story is that Toyota knows about these problems and kept letting dealers sell this defective car. This is not an isolated incident, check Toyota Nation to read other owners with this same issue. Toyota is finally issuing a bulletin to the dealer on these problems. The dealer will fix it under warranty but I don't feel the same, I expect a new car to be trouble free not have to be rebuilt.

Title: 2013 Avalon Ltd Hybrid
Review:  Had planned to purchase a Lexus 300H but found local Lexus dealers not buyer friendly.Decided to look at the Avalon as an alternative and made a purchase which I now regret.The hybrid platform performs wonderfully; power is adequate and economy is better than expected.So far with 5000 miles average MPG is 40.1 with 70pc highway at speeds 70+ MPH.My main issue with the vehicle is interior build quality/fit/finish. I have owned many cars over the years and not since the early 70's have I had a car with so many interior rattles.It is unpleasant to drive the vehicle on anything but newly paved roads.Ride quality is firm, but not unpleasant and seats are adequate for long drives.

Title: Getting my 2013 Avalon Repaired
Review:  I live in Alpharetta Ga and recently purchased a 2013 Avalon Touring Edition.I'm enjoying the car. However; I'm very disappointed with the dealership for customer "No Service". I took my car in for it's 5k servicing. A clip to the back panel of my drivers seat was faulty and the panel is coming off. I was told to come back tomorrow and they would repair it.When I drove back the next day, I waited 45 minutes for them to tell me they don't have one but will in a week. They would call me.They didn't. I call again, left message with service technician to call me. He did not. Called again. Part not in until October 24. Mind you it's August 29th.

Title: Just What I Needed
Review:  This is my "highway" car.Drove to NEPA Pocono Area with my electronic drums in the trunk. The July shakedown cruise to our yearly SummerJam proved the Avalon's capability.I tend to travel fast (above the speed limit) and got almost 30 MPG while feeling safe and in control.Love the transmission and the steering and despite what MT may say about "steering feedback" I didn't find that a negative since I didn't want a "sports car" or want to "feel the road".Spent almost three weeks driving around the N.E.P.A. area roads that I grew up driving on (I live in Tampa), these are what we call "driving! roads".Again, the car made it a blast - it went everywhere like it owned the road.UPDATE 2/24/2016The Multi-media system that controls the GPS and entertainment went bad in Dec. '15 while on a short get away outside my home state. I carry a Garmin as a backup, whew. My dealership and Toyota stepped up in top shelf fashion and in a week the car was fixed, detailed and ready.  The car is still performing as originally reviewed and the MPG is improving as the car breaks in. I miss not having back seats that fold down and find that the sun really plays havoc on my eyes when reflected in the chrome that trims the interior - which happens all too suddenly and frequently. Sunglasses and seat positioning are not solutions. Someone suggested flat black tape but I'm just not sure it's an aesthetic I could tolerate...unless this becomes a safety issue. As great as the interior looks the chrome could be a deal breaker for a future Avalon.

Title: Downsized - I hate that!
Review:  Really got sucked in by the new and beautiful exterior of the 2013 Avalon.Only to find it so very uncomfortable compared to my 2011.Did not sink in until after the purchase that this car is 2" shorter than it's predecessor, with most of that coming off the rear passenger leg room,which is Critical TOYOTA!I often have my office associates with me, and they are big guys!Now they are cramped!Why would you make the flagship car.... SMALLER?If I wanted small, I would buy the Camry.And the front seat is narrower, and less comfortable.Front seat comfort of the Avalon has always been an issue; now it's much worse!(for the distance driver).

Title: Great Car but...
Review:  2013 Avalon Limited with every option. I really enjoy my Avalon. I would put it at 4 out of five stars for about every category. Overall, this car represents value for the money. It is sporty yet refined, pretty fun to drive if you never push the limits and has enough technology built in. It has its faults like every car and Toyota. It's no sports car. And for a Toyota I am not impressed with the build quality. Surprising problems with a falling headliner and rattling door with the stereo playing. I haven't had the rear view or dash glare problems that some have complained about. I mostly think those are bogus. Toyota's Entune works sporadically with my iPhone 4 and I am disappointed with it

I constantly put customers in my car and being 6'4"in any other car the person behind me never had room. Not they have a good 4" of extra leg room. Not the fastest car but it isn't the slowest.

Title: Very Disappointed!!
Review:  A new car and the Headliner is already peeling, the dealership gave no explanation and said they have ordered a new one, seriously is this new Toyota standards. Cabin noise is too much on the highway. Took to my dealer, the supervisor of the service center said cabin noise was normal. For a high end car which is comparable to the Lexus ES350 I think the cabin noise is too much and Toyota must do something about it. Anyone else who has the Avalon please put your reviews on NHTSA.gov and Edmunds. AT 75 mph I hear a lot of wind noise around the car and at one point there was a lot of noise coming from the front windshield and Toyota and the dealership are not willing to fix it.

Title: harsh ride derails a good car
Review:  Previous Avalon owners will be shocked at how harsh the ride of 2013 Avalon is. Small bumps are transmitted as sharp kicks into the cabin. Road noise is also pronounced on worn asphalt roads. The style of the car makes a rear view camera a must, however its an option. the camera is standard on the Honda accord. Headlights also have a sharp cutoff that makes reading some road signs difficult. The touch sensitive switches make it to easy to activate the wrong control.

Title: Avalon - A luxury but affordable full size sedan
Review:  Before anything else, let me say this "this is the third Toyota I owned and drove more than 160,000 on my previous two without any breakdown or problem even a minor one. I looked for a comfortable full size sedan for my family with two kids instead of a minivan or SUV due to MPG issue. I decided to purchase an Avalon XLE after test drive of Ford Taurus, Nissan Maxima & Infinity G37..So far I confidently say I made a right choice. The car handling may not be as sporty as the Infinity, inside its cabin we can really enjoy the quality of the Bluetooth audio system because it is so quite thanks to the use of noise reduction glass & its air drag coefficient of 0.28.

Title: High tire pressure ride problems.
Review:  Recently bought this fine vehicle and almost didn't because of harsh suspension response when impacting large road patches and other road irregularities. Drove another car before the one I took home for the little woman to see and drive. Both cars had 18" Michelins and were disappointing in the way they reacted to serious road imperfections. Driving the car I ultimately bought decided to check the tire air pressure. All tires checked just a little shy of 40lbs. Obviously being over inflated by at least 6lbs will cause the ride problems I noticed.With the correct tire pressure the over all ride improved drastically. I would suggest before you road test one check the air pressure.I have traded this vehicle. Overall a very fine car but if you drive with both feet I.E. brake with your left foot and apply throttle with your right you can trigger the brake override safety feature which means you suddenly loose power for about 8-10 seconds. This was a real safety issue for me and as such was a design flaw. We had decided we would be better served with a SUV going forward and I did not want another Toyota product for obvious reasons. Fortunately there are some good choices out there and we are very happy with our new SUV.

Great handling/ride/responsiveness.Our trip was around 3300 miles and averaged 31.0 MPG - in combined driving - fully loaded.This was somewhat surprizing, as the lowest MPG was 27, when climbing into higher elevations.Great Toyota- great ride.

Title: Nice ride but needs a few things.
Review:  The Avalon is nice and has a high quality interior look. But the things that you notice after you buy the car matter. The seats need some more cushion. We rode a couple hours before our bottoms hurt. My Corolla is a good 5 1/2 hour seat. Where are the bottle holders in the doors?They are absent front and rear. So on a trip with three in the back with the armrest folded up, the rear seat passengers will not have a single place to store drinks. I like more than one drink myself, especially living in a desert area. I would also appreciate it if the two cupholders up front were cooled. Power is good in this V/6, Best mileage on a road trip with a full trunk and three passengers was 29.5 mpg hwy

Bought car 50 miles away from home and local dealership ask where I bought car from. The moral of this post is, dont buy car at night and make sure you love every inch when you drive it off the lot as Toyota is not really willing to stand behind any defect they may have left you with. Good product, Poor Customer support. Toyota should learn how to stand behind there product better!

The handling is great, good acceleration to get around traffic on the interstate. The seats are very comfortable. Entune is nice, the navigation is easier to manage than my 08 Sequoia Limited. I don't have the phone charging plate which is a head scratcher.

Review:  Everything seems to be perfect with 2013 Avalon.But, unfortunately, the clock is awful, to say the least.It is not digital, and you can only read 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock, or 15, 30, and 45 minutes.In-between there are no marks.So, one literally has to stare at the clock for a minute to judge the positions of hour and minute handles in order to figure out the exact time.A clock inside a car should be functional not for decoration purpose, because when one is driving on the highway, he has only microseconds to read the clock without causing an accident.It is totally beyond me why Toyota "design" a clock that people can't read the time from.

Title: Very pleased from a car guy
Review:  I have 1000 miles on my 2013 Avalon. I am very impressed with the car. I am a bit of a car nut. I own 5 cars, a 1970 Trans Am, a 1976 Bronco, both consistent show winners, a Corvette convertible, and a Z71 Tahoe. I purchased the Avalon on November 30. I traded in a 2009 Cadillac CTS that was loaded with every option, 3.6 DI engine and all wheel drive. I do not regret my decision at all. This car is fantastic. In comparison to the CTS the car is quiter, smoother, handles better and I think its faster. It is much roomier and the fit and finish are first rate. I first test drove the 2013 ES and I find that the Avalon is less soft, more of a drivers car and the quality seemed the same.

Title: ONE YEAR IN! SOLID, FAST CAR! WORTH CHECKING OUT!!
Review:  I have owned several cars and trucks in my time. From BMW's to GMC's. My last vehicle was a Jaguar S Type. That was luxury and speed. I had an '05 that I bought off lease. It was great, but time caught up with it. Enter my Avalon. I (again) bought a lease return (2015 Model) with low mileage. This car handles well, has speed, and solid braking. When I have to (on occasion) I have blown BMW's and Lexis drivers off the line.  This ride has a 3.5 L V-6, and 268 HP....it's Fast! The ride is on the firm side, although you have options for eco and sport as well. The chassis is the same as the lower end Lexis models. It has all the bells and whistles (heated seats, various dash screens for computer mileage, eco boost, etc, bluetooth, and sat radio). Climate system works nicely. Inside the cabin, there is a bit of a "plastic feel", and the silver foil that wraps the cup holders is starting to peel. Those are the only complaints!! I  had this car for one year...and ZERO Problems! Just change the oil and rotate the tires so far. Mileage is 21 in and around town, and (I know this may be had to believe!) I got 31 MPG on a recent 200 mile R/T!! This is a SOLID, well produced car that has styling as well as reliability, and the all important SPEED!  As an owner, I can highly recommend this vehicle!!

Review:  Bought the car new in March of 2016. I have bought 5 new and 4 used Toyotas in my life. This one has small problems Toyota won’t cover. There are 17 small tears in inch wide piece of defective leather Toyota wont replace under Warranty. I have spent well over$150,000 on Toyotas in my life and am afraid this will be the last. I have never had a problem with another manufacturer in my life. They should be embarrassed and ashamed. Said tears in leather is normal wear and tear on a $35,000.00 list  car with 16,000 miles on it. Good car but garbage company. Traded car in couldnt stand looking at ripped seat anymore.

Title: too much routine maintenance required at a high $
Review:  carefully check the service and maintenance details especially for required (routine maintenance) . I have owned the car for 15 months and have put 12,2OO  miles on it under normal driving conditions. the car is designed to require a rotation of the tires every 5,000 miles as a maintenance message comes on  and stays on replacing other important information. One must go to the dealer to have tires rotated.This negates the benefit of the10,000 MILE OIL CHANGE INTERVAL. in addition the following have been required; a new battery , oil leak in the transmission but no repair required at this time, 4 wheel alignment  required shortly after the warranty for such service expired. I purchased this car with the belief that toyota's last a an extended period of time and hundreds of thousands of miles. it obviously is going to require a great deal of time  in the dealership and unknown amounts of money. Nothing about the car  was explained adequately from day one.

Title: Glare is a safety issue.
Review:  I have been driving this car for a year. The vehicle came with tint installed by the dealer.  The rear glass is angled in such a way that it produces excessive glare.  This affects visibility, and increases the risk of a collision when backing up or shifting lanes. I've already had a few close calls because of this issue.  In addition, the navigation screen is likewise prone to excessive glare from sunlight passing thru the front glass.  Not only is it difficult to see the navigation map but it limits the usefulness of the back up camera. I have the touring version, equipped with 18 inch wheels. When the road is well paved, the ride is quiet and smooth; however, road imperfections are transmitted into the cabin in a pronounced manner. I also own a Mazda 3 and a Volkswagen Golf, and these compact cars absorb bumps and potholes better. Lastly, Entune is so erratic that it is exasperating to use. I've owned several Toyotas in the past, and I have to say, this one was a bit disappointing.

Review:  Besides the Avalon I currently have a 2008 Ford Edge and a 2015 Ford Fusion.  I bought the Avalon to replace a 2005 Cadillac because the Caddy had a hard life and was worn out and didn't want to spend Cadillac size dollars on another car.  All have order of magnitude better entertainment systems than my new Avalon.  Even the aging Cadillac. The stereo sounds as if there is only a single dash mounted speaker and fidelity is worse than AM of my other cars.  GPS needs to ne replaced too.  The only function I find acceptable is the hands free phone.  We like the styling, ride, comfort, handling, safety features and performance.  Gas mileage is not spectacular, but acceptable for a V6.If I could I figure out how to replace the entertainment system and those awful speakers I would in a heartbeat.

Title: Lexus price but not Lexus quality
Review:  After disappointment with the quality decline in Honda's interior trim I decided to go with Toyota and thought their flagship would be well worth it.  I assumed I was getting a car commensurate in quality with its price, but boy was I wrong.  First, the positive.  The engine is well matched with this car and it has adequate pickup, particularly in sport mode.  It makes a very subtle but noticeable difference in acceleration.  Unfortunately, sport mode must be selected every time you drive as the car only retains normal or eco mode when you turn off the engine.  Minor detail.  The other positive is that the interior is very well laid out and looks great.  As for quality, the wind and road noise is quite noticeable in this car.  It's not a deal killer, but it is more than I would expect for something with a $40k+ MSRP.  There are also some really stupid choices Toyota made with this car such as the Nav/phone system.  I understand that certain things deactivate when you're moving, but using hands-free calling can be a hassle because if you need to call a number with an automated phone tree (for example, calling Toyota) and you must enter in a number prompt instead of speaking it, you have to pick up your phone and dial it from there.  The number pad on the car's screen deactivates.  So much for the "safety" aspect of hands-free.  In terms of quality, Toyota must've gone on vacation.  My analog speedometer is about 3 mph off from the digital one, an insignificant deal but an annoyance regardless.  This is common to these cars, but Toyota will not fix it as 1-3 mph variance is "within tolerance."  The seat heaters are nice, but the seat coolers are next to useless.  I've had seat coolers that work, but these don't do much at all.  There is also an annoying buzz/rattle coming from the door panels when the radio is on.  After four fruitless attempts to get this fixed at the dealership and with no help from the corporate office I finally took the doors apart myself and added a ton of soundproofing material.  It mitigated the issue, but I really don't think DIY is an acceptable solution to a manufacturing issue on a new, much less "flagship," vehicle.  Then, there's the stereo itself.  It sounds great...  when it works.  It randomly loses connectivity with my phone and has, on multiple occasion, gone into a sequence of rebooting itself.  The problem is intermittent and cannot be replicated, so Toyota offers no assistance on fixing it.  Lastly, the car has developed an intermittent hesitation when it starts.  As best I could, I tracked it down to times when the car sat for an hour or two and the temperature was warm and humid.  I even provided video proof of it occurring.  Initially, Toyota stated that they cannot replicate the issue and ignored it, but I finally was able to get them to acknowledge it as an issue.  However, their response was to blame me and state that "I was pushing the button wrong."  I'm not sure how that could be the case, but I went several rounds with them before finally giving up in frustration.  While the engine has yet to not start at all, I suspect it is a matter of time as issues with cars rarely get better on their own and often progress.I've purchased several cars over the years and must say that this is the most disappointing one I've owned.  It's not the worst, but I expected much more based on Toyota's reputation and the fact that this is their flagship.  The best decision I made with this car was to trade it in.  Never again, Toyota.

Title: Great Great Car!
Review:  This is my 3rd Toyota, I have had a 2005 Toyota Solara, a 2012 Toyota Camry and now a 2015 Toyota Avalon XLE Touring! I completely love this car! I am in my 30's and this car is awesome! Definitely not a old persons car anymore. It is just beautiful, and rides nicely. I really do not have any complaints, but the fuel cost are so low for a V6 and you can use regular gasoline. I feel like I am driving a Lexus.

Title: Toyota Avalon-not just for the silver set anymore
Review:  We have had exceptional luck with our Toyota cars, as they've lasted 300k+ miles. We started looking at Camrys for our 21 year old daughter. But once she saw the inside of an Avalon, there was no other choice for her. She LOVES the styling, and there are all sorts of tech features that she can't live without. According to her, few people over age 55 could take advantage of all the technology (but they can still drive it!). As a marketing and animation major, she has a real eye for design, and this car won hands down over many others.

Title: Luxury and quality for less
Review:  I just got the 2015 limited in year end clearance; I got the best price for the best car.  I test BMW 3 series, Cadillac ATS, Buick Regal and Lacrosse. I found Avalon limited on the top line in term of luxury, tech, stylish, smooth and quiet on free way on par with Lacrosse but better tech, gas mileage, expect more reliable than Lacrosse.  But I was disappointed a bid on free way, I don't much wind but tire sound with the road on the 18' wheel.  The Avalon has plenty of power though it has only 268 hp and 248 torque compared to 3 series, regal, lacrosse, ATS are more power and torque but I did not feel much different.  The ATS, Regal, and 3 Series are good for quick move and corner but more windy on freeway when Lacrosse on the to ride on freeway-- smooth, quiet, and balance due to its heavy weight 4000lb vs Avalon 3560lb but 18city/28 hwy vs 21city/31 hwy.  Quality, luxury, stylish, and bargain price at the end of the year make me to pick Avalon limited over the rest.

Title: Duck!
Review:  The ride is sporty. . .not luxury.  Stiffer ride with 17" wheels.  Getting into the driver's seat requires you to be a contortionist.  Once inside. . .it's great.  Comfortable seats. . .responsive, easy steering. . .good acceleration.  My wife likes the car. . .I can't deal with the contortion required to get into the driver's seat.  There is also some wind noise that is greater than it should be. I would prefer wheels that provide more of a cushion.  My reason to trade is the issue with getting into the vehicle.  I can't do that day after day.

Title: Lower Your Expectations
Review:  We purchased a 2015 Avalon in July.  It was a nice vehicle but the more I drove it, the more I realized it did not meet my expectations.  Due to it's reputation, I expected the "flotation" ride of a luxury car.  I also had issues with wind noise and bumping my head getting in and out.   (Not a vehicle for people who have any difficulty getting in and out of a car).  To say I was extremely disappointed is an understatement.  The dealership could do nothing about the wind noise....... we even tested one straight off the lot when I came to pick mine up from Service.  It did the same thing.  My aunt had purchased a 2015 Av Hybrid around the same time.  When I spoke with her, she said that she had not realized now noisy her 2015 Avalon was until they went on a trip in a friend's Ford F150.  Now that's sad that a pickup was quieter than a luxury car!!!  I traded in a 2013 Kia Soul that I just loved other than the ride.  It had zero wind noise!!!!!!   Complained to Toyota's Houston division but since it is not a safety hazard, they deemed nothing was wrong with the car or it's design and offered no alternatives in terms of helping me purchase a different vehicle.  My only recourse was to go back to the dealership and trade it in.   I now own a 2016 4Runner and LOVE it.  Yes, it is not sound proof, but it rides better and is more comfortable than my LAST purchase of a "luxury" vehicle.  I use the term "luxury" loosely and sarcastically.  BCS

Title: Original Owner for 14+ years/ 334 thousand miles
Review:  Greatest purchase of a lifetime! This car has survived a family of 4, both my son and my daughter have driven many miles with this vehicle. The rims are aluminum and did not fair well when driven into curbs. My son (20) was able to blow the sub-woofer and destroy the transmission at 180 thousand miles. Only recently has the engine light gone on for the catalytic converter. The car will drive 419 miles on a full tank of gas before the low gas warning light is lit. Today when I drive this car I drive for over 2 hours with the full confidence I had when I bought this car brand new during January 2003. Update May 2017: the catalytic converter 420 light only goes on after 2 1/2 hours of driving.

Title: Reliable where it counts and nowhere else
Review:  Overall, I really like my '03 Avalon, but there are some quirks that do need to be stated. The subwoofer in the rear is very low quality. I was already not a fan of the sound system that this car came with but after 2 weeks of owning it, I decided to max out the the volume to see how it handled and ended up blowing the subwoofer. Turns out that this is a very common problem for all Toyotas that have this JBL system in it. They dry rot in the sun and weekend very quickly. When this happens, I would recommend just buying a 50 watt sub that's 4 ohms and 8" in diameter because the stock sub cost around $280 online and a complete ripoff. They're hard to fine but do exist. Another very common problem is that the windshield wiper motor will go out unexpectedly. You will know when it happens because it won't take the wiper back down to the "park" position when you turn them off. I just got a quote from my local dealer and it will cost $487 to fix that. Finally, trying to maintain this car in your driveway is a pain. It's nearly impossible to get to the oil filter with just a floor jack. Oil changes for me cost around $40 to have my local shop do it. This is a great car for someone that prefers to take it to a shop whenever something needs done. If you would rather maintain it yourself, I'd look at something else.

I do hate looking at the cassette tape deck  (it reminds me that I am getting older and soon will someday be obsolete). I keep wanting to replace it with something new, but other new cars can't match it's ride. I test drove the 2014 Mercedes, new Avalon, Lexus, infinity, BMW... The only car I liked better than the Avalon was the Audi A8 at $65,000. I will keep this car until it literally falls apart. Update: I now have 217,000 miles and still love the car and have had no problems except the recall on the airbags.  Running strong and smooth.

Review:  At 140k my Avalon seems like it will endure for many more years and miles. Unusual maintenance includes a steering bracket assembly and a failed subwoofer. Also, the driver's seat cushion has collapsed and the airbag light comes on intermittently. The car whooshes to speed, is dead quiet, and has expansive room on the inside. The gas mileage is not great (avg. 22 in mixed driving), but this is a large auto and its substantial feel makes me want to keep it forever. The styling is distinct and operating costs are very low. After driving an Avalon, it becomes difficult to settle for lesser cars.

My wife felt the looks needed some pizazz, so I bought a spoiler online and had a bodyshop paint and install it for her birthday present.  It adds a lot of character.  A few months later, I bought a 2003 Lexus ES 300 and driving one car is almost like driving the other, although the Lexus has a few more amenities.

Clutch is not as smooth as Japanese cars.  Great head and leg room (I'm six-two).  Very quiet with top up at high speeds (much less wind noise than the Sebring).  Heated seats (with five settings) are great!  Gas mileage is poor (24 mpg) for a small car with a clutch with weak acceleration.  Nice, solid build quality, pretty looking, but it is a chick car.  Oil change is very expensive due to synthetic only and a non-standard filter.  Trunk holds a lot but small opening.  I like the car but glad we lease.

Title: Not for Cold Weather!!!
Review:  The car is beautiful and performs well in the warm weather.  It is much better on fuel than my Jeep Wrangler.  It really makes my wife happy and I like that.  The problem is that the windows have to open (when the handle is pulled) to open the door.  If it gets below 20 degrees, the windows won't open. That means that you can't get in, and if you finally do, you can't close the door or the glass will break. Because of the security VW voids the warranty if you install an aftermarket remote starter and they do not offer one.

Review:  My 2005 was so good, I had to have the Triple white special edition.  I wanted white in 2004 when I bought the first one, now I am complete.  Great performance and always a compliment from passers-by.

Title: Luv my Convertible
Review:  I have had the Beetle convertible for about 1 year (not driving it in the winter months).  I totally love it.  It is fun, reliable and has enough pep for me.  I was surprised by the amount of room in the trunk, as I expected virtually nothing.  Just really really pleased. I do miss a change holder, as there is no easy place to put a few dollars.

Title: Bug Time
Review:  I have the 5-speed, and do enjoy the car's drive and handling.  150HP is plenty in car this size, and I have no complaints about acceleration (Go Bug, Go!).  The ABS braking system and anti-skid functions seem to work well.  I had several opportunities to drive it in the snow this year, and it seemed to handle that challenge quite well.   Though it presents some restrictions, I do appreciate the Bug's styling, as it sets it apart from other cars its size,

Title: Still Fun, but No Improvement
Review:  The '07 Beetle still lacks the charisma of the old Beetle.  So?  We should expect more for the more money we pay.  How about power seats (sit higher, too), locks, mirrors, a better stereo (MP4), free DVD navigation, cool electronics?  Eliminate the pillar and rear blind spots.  Give it a better trunk lock.  How about the top receding into the boot with an automatic tonneau cover or an power hard top?  Give it more power.  The handling needs work.  It has a firm ride, cut the sponginess.  Hey, give it better gas mileage, please!  Also, give us attractive mirrors.

Title: LOVE THE LEMON!
Review:  I purchased my 2007 baby in 2010, Houston Tx and it was shipped from Florida.  Very good vehicle, performance, reliability, got caught in 2 floods water middle ways my tires and I made it through, no hesitation no problems afterwards, wonderful!  I love the air tight, heavy doors!  When shipped a lot of repairs had to be done to get it ready. But the factory warranty covered everything accept the $100 per pop!  After the factory warranty ended I purchased extended warranty that covered other repairs, but for about 1 1/2 years, because the value of my car is only $5,000, the extended warranty no longer covers, it's all on me and it has been a very expensive 2 years, seems like everything is falling apart.  And because some parts takes a long to get here, I have also paid much in rental cars. A matter of fact it's in the shop as I speak, ignition housing went out and has to be re-keyed etc., gone take 8-15 days before part arrives, go figure the cost of this rental for 15 days!  I think it may be time to move on!

Title: My second New Beetle not as good as the first
Review:  I previously owned a 2000 New Beetle 1.8T. That car was GREAT. It gave me very few problems, and it never left me stranded. One of the worse mistakes I have made. I've had lots of stupid problems come up. I bought the car with 68k miles, and all service records. I had no warning and the water pump went out, at 68.5k. Replaced two wheel bearings, the tie rods, the door speaker. I could go on. I have had this car a little over a year. The best part was when the inner axle snapped getting off the highway. I think my car must be a lemon. It is getting harder and harder to justify keeping it.My car looks great, but it doesn't perform half as well as my 2000 did, which had twice the miles.

Title: in love with my Beetle
Review:  Bought this car new from the dealer and it's given me a couple of problems but overall I don't regret the purchase. Its sole appearance makes me happy every time I look at it. I seriously love my car.My only complain is that the parts, oil changes and even the coolant are very expensive. To be objective, I have to mention that entering its 4th year (2011), little things here and there started to break down, for example the interior roof liner is coming loose on the edges, antenna broke when covered the car with an ordinary car cover and one of the windshield washers seems to be clogged. My compressor died this year too ($2000)... and the battery and the headlights but that's to be expected

Title: Grrr!!
Review:  I love my car, especially since its paid off. But in september an ignition coil went out., Then in march 2 more went within 2 weeks of each other. Now less than 4 weeks later another one has just gone out. The only thing saving me from driving this car off a cliff, besides the repairs being covered under warranty, is the fact there is only 1 ignition coil left to go out. And VW wont replace it until it fails. I just hope it doesnt happen late at nite or when im on my way to an interview. I just dont need this aggrevation, but since I dont have a job I cant go trade this in. Hopefully the 5th coil will go out soon and I can stop worrying...

Title: Sadly Disappointed
Review:  Having driven a classic Beetle as a teenager, this car was a major disappointment.  Three months after buying the car, the fuel pump relay died leaving me stranded at 10:00 pm.  Three years after buying the car, I traded it in for a 2010 Honda Fit. The lights and radio wouldn't work when it was cold. The heater wouldn't work when the car was idling. The driver's headlight had to be replaced due to "faulty wiring". Upon acceleration or deceleration, the car would often hesitate. After a snow storm, snow would often get trapped in the wheel well causing the car to shake at speeds above 40 mph. Living in Nebraska, it's important to have a reliable car.

Review:  I bought the car new in 2007 and have enjoyed it ever since. Good performance, but the handling could be a little tighter. MPG is constantly around the 30 mark. I have 40000 miles on it and it has not given me any trouble. There were a couple of squeaks/rattles at the beginning but they have since vanished. I would recommend this car from my personal experience. Happy Motoring.

Title: Love it!
Review:  This was my 2nd Beetle and I absolutely love this car! I recently sold mine since my family needs space. The car is very sturdy and well-built. I was impressed with how well it handled in stormy weather on the interstate. I also loved the space once the back seat folds down. It was spacious enough for my 75 pound Lab in her cage. I never experienced mechanical problems with it. My only complaint was the oil change would cost me $70 or more. This car requires Synthetic oil, which is more expensive than regular oil.

Review:  I drove the car from Arizona to Mississippi and back. I got 24 to 30 MPG on the trip driving at an average speed of 75MPH on the interstate. I get 23 - 24 MPG driving around Phoenix on a daily basis.  I love the torque. It is hard not to spin the tires from a full stop. I get some strange looks from the Mustang owners when that happens. I am 6'3" and have lots of head room but I had to remove the center arm rest to make room for my elbows. Now there is a big hole in the console but I'm comfortable. The road noise is the one thing I wish was better. Thankfully Phoenix put rubberized asphalt on all the freeways. It is very fun to drive.

Title: I'm in Love..! Could be a race car..
Review:  Love the Laser Blue color.!!  This Beetle is much peppier than the old 2004 - 4 cylinder engine.  Only drawback is when you drive fast you get 20 to 23 MPG in the city.  The heated seats are the best new feature.!  I wish the visors were wider or perhaps extended longer because they don't block side sun glare very well.  The comfort is great, and the room is great.  I have hauled a lot of stuff in this little car.  My only other request is to make this car a hybrid.  I have gotten 34 MPG highway using speed control.  I beat an Austin Mini Cooper in a drag race and matched a Corvette for the first 50 yards, so this car is FAST.!  Thanks VW for a car more fun than my 2004 New Beetle.!

Title: First Time Beetle Owner
Review:  I have owned by Beetle for 7 months and have had no problems. I love this car. At first the look impressed me the most. I finally found a 5-speed, green model which was hard to come by. The way this car handles is great. It hugs the road and is the ultimate road-trip car. The fifth cylinder can really be felt on a steep incline and the cold-weather package has helped me through many a snowy morning! It handles in 6 inches of snow, no problem, and the sunroof makes the summer weather even better! If you are looking for a fun car with a low-maintenance feel and features then this is the car for you!

Title: Not worth it in the long run
Review:  A car is supposed to be a reliable transportartion and reliable it is not.  Too many trips to the service department, too many recalls, too many service lights coming on worrying me about even more problems.  I see likewise frustrated people at the service counter everytime I come in. I'm charged an arm and a leg every time, without a guarantee that the fix will work.  A 10 year old KIA has had no problems.  I got too excited about aesthetics of it.  But the features don't work and have to be repeatedly fixed.  If only I read more reviews of long-term owners.  Never another VW again.  They are nice when on the dealer lot, but in reality too much trouble.

Title: New Vdub rush
Review:  This is my first foreign car and now I get it.  This car is quite impressive all around.  I love this car.  It is comfortable, enjoyable, affordable, even if the gas mileage isn't stellar.  It sure beats my old 2006 PT Cruiser which was getting 17 mpg city.  You can't help but smile when driving the Beetle.  It sticks to the road and is very quick and I feel extremely safe in it even though it is a small car.  Don't over think and criticize the back seat.  It is more than enough.  So the head room isn't excessive, I have had 4 door sedans that were just as bad.  Enjoy the ride.

Title: Still fun, still not dependable
Review:  Having owned another Beetle and a Jetta before this, I have come to realize that VWs on average have a shelf life of about 4 years, then it's time to trade it in!  Despite the frustrations that come with being a VW owner, I keep coming back over and over. Why? The handling - the driving experience. There are so few cars on the market, in my opinion, that combine compactness and great handling. Having driven other compact makes, I find that the Beetle is heavier, handles better, has better features and more road presence. While other compacts feel like they are likely to get blown off the road in a high wind, the Beetle tends to clutch the road and hold its own in snow, rain, etc.

Title: Another New New Beetle
Review:  I sold my red 99 Beetle last summer. I was missing it terribly! Last month I bought a new 07, yellow this time. I'm so happy to have a Beetle again. It's easy to park, fun to drive, cleans up nicely and compared to my pick-up truck and Jaguar, economical to keep the tank full. These are cute little cars. I enjoyed my last one and still see it around town. (It's much loved and still looks great.) I know that if the day comes that I must part with this one, it will also find the right person to love it. In the 99 I don't miss the old cup holders or cloth/fabric seats. The 07 has leather, better cup holders and a much needed arm rest. Old one was manual, this one is automatic, no opinion.

Title: Former Benz & BMW Now Beetle Girl
Review:  Wow. I have been a Benz and Beemer girl for many years. I wanted a change, and found it with the Beetle. While I love luxury, I like simplicity. I like speed, but not Grand Prix MPH. I want comfort, but not so much that I do not know what to do with it. I love my new Beetle. It is roomier than my former BMW 325i. The trunk is bigger, but configured differently. It runs a little rougher than my old BMW, but we are talking a $20,000 car vs. a $40,000 car. You get what you pay for. The ease of driving and engineering of devices is so easy. BMW and Benz take brain power to figure it all out. VW is simple and, well, simple. The Beetle is comfy, fun, and costs much less money.  I love it!

This is my first VW, and I've heard horrible rants about their warranty department, so hopefully everything will go smoothly, and nothing major will go wrong. I've only had the car almost a month, and as of right now, I couldn't be happier!

Title: My Horror Story
Review:  This was my first car at the age of 18. When I got my Beetle, it had about 72,000 miles on it, and not even 4 months after receiving it, the problems began. Immediately, my transmission died completely. My warranty company gave me a $4,000 check and voided my warranty after seeing the $12,000 repair bill. Then, the battery died. Twice. As did the alternator and air conditioning. My rear window also got stuck and that would have cost me 4 hours of labor fees just to get to the broken bits. It's not like I drove it a lot - over a course of 3 years I didn't even drive 10,000 miles. For the love of god, stay away from this car. It is one problem after another, literally every 3-5 months.Update:It has been two years since I got my new car. I have named it "Not Beetle," and have had zero problems with it. Turns out the secret of German engineering is to buy a Korean car instead.

Review:  2003 Convertible, lightly driven with 43000 miles.Transmission failed, due to what now appears to be a known problem with the "valve body". VW support extremely poor. This car looks nice but has been nothing but trouble: windows do not work correctly, have been fixed twice, roof gets stuck and VW fitter wanted $1500 to repair (it took me 10 minutes to snap the loose clip back on and cost nothing - so much for service. Everything is a hassle to repair - battery is over $200, bulbs cannot be replaced easily, airbag light cost $250 to temporarily repair. If you want the beetle style spend the money on a restored air cooled one, from when VW knew how to make serviceable vehicles!

I've had the seat belt/airbag sensors replaced, various other sensors, the catalytic converter and every time I get in it there's seems to be some dash light that comes on indicating a problem.  The car has 75,000 miles on it and is a lot of fun to drive, but I'm not recommending purchasing a Beetle because of the issues it has had.  I've written a letter to the headquarters regarding the issues along with receipts from my repairs.  Every time I take it to the dealer they want to charge $80+ for diagnostics.  I'm at the point now that I'm looking to purchase another vehicle because of the problems I've had.

Review:  I love this car.  I'm a BIG guy and I have all of the comfort of my Chrysler 300.  The only issue I've had is with the convertible top.  I've had it in 4 times because some cables in the raising and lowering mechanism come off track and get caught up in the whole works and it screws up the top liner.  It seems to be fixed, but now it happened to the other side and it pulled more cables loose, part of the interior molding and broke some other pieces that are down inside.  I've only had the car for 9 months and have only been putting the top down for 3 of them.  It only had 24,000 miles when I got it!

The interior is not impressive either.  The door handles' plastic coating wore through. The cigarette lighter pop out (I don't smoke) won't shut properly.  They said they just glue them shut (!).  It looks great from afar, but the quality isn't there.  But what really makes me mad is the $$ it has cost me to repair all the stuff.  Dont buy one!  No matter how fun it is to drive or how cute it looks with the top down, you might be looking at a lemon.

Review:  Fell in love with this car and bought it new.  Within the first three months, I think it was in the shop about 4 times.  Since then, particularly during summer months, it's in the shop on average about once every 6 weeks.  Have had problems with the windows, the speakers, the battery (twice), the roof has broken countless times, the wiring on the tail lights, the airbag sensors, the blinker - and the door, which still isn't fixed.  Also, the service at my dealership is terrible.  They once replaced the wrong airbag so the sensor came back on a couple days later.  I would ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND this car.  They take no accountability and I will never purchase another VW, no matter how cute.

Title: Is it a Lemon?
Review:  I bought this car used with only 20,000 miles on it.  My first car was the old VW, and ever since they came out with the new models I always wanted one.  In the 13,000 miles I have put on it in one year, I have taken it to the shop 10 times.  The manufacturers warranty has now run out (not due to mileage, but to age) and now I have to use the extended warranty I purchased from Carmax.  But they don't know how to fix VW's so I must pay extra to take it to a dealer!  (I was never informed of this!)  I have had electrical problems with the windows, top problems where it wouldn't go up or come down at times, overheating problems (3 times!), now I am finished!  I am trading in this car tomorrow!

Title: Poor Craftsmanship, Gas Mileage, and Reliability
Review:  This car looks nice, rides nice, but then things start to break.  I've replaced the convertible top, driver's door, key cylinder, all the window motors, various sensors in the engine, and the convertible flaps.  So much goes wrong. I'm in a love / hate relationship with this thing. I love to drive it and I love the windshield angle / distance, but hate the constant breakdowns.  A door replacement took three weeks to fix. This car is not worth it.  Find something else.

Title: A nice Bug
Review:  The pros: Fun with top down, people love to look at it, reliable, zippy power, vinyl no dead cows to sit on, windsheild is not in your face, lots of head room. Some things that disapoint me: The stupidly short sun visor that doesnt even cover 1/4 of the window to block the sun from the side. I had to get one of those kids sun shades that suctions to the giant side window. The seats are not made for long rides or if you have any kind of back trouble. The pedals are high so if you are tall, its hard to get comfortable. I still have trouble adjusting to the seat, doesn't go back far enough. The back seat is for kids only, it has no comfort.  I like the car overall but the comfort is poor. Not it is not for old people.

Title: Cute, but at a pricy
Review:  I have to say, I love my Beetle Convertible, but I am not impressed with VW's reliability or dealer service. In less than 19,000 miles my Beetle has COMPLETELY broken down twice, and I had to have it towed both times through roadside assistance.  In fact the first one was on my way home from vacation in Florida, and the delay was not a pleasant expereience.  So far I've had the entire ignition system replaced, new battery and alternator and most recently had to have the front bumper removed just to fix a broken sensor. (A "quick" 6 business day fix) I think VW is right on target with their design and engineering, but they just don't make it all work.  I will not be buying another VW.

Title: With the wind in my hair...
Review:  Never thought I'd have a VW, much less a convertible, but here I am.  This car is so cute, fun and fun to drive.  I've had the top down non-stop and have had to figure out the best way to keep my hair fixed and out of my face!  Gee, what a problem to have!  I'm 30 w/no kids and 2 dogs.  Can't wait to buy doggles for the dogs to wear in the back seat...with the wind blowing in their hair...

Title: No Problems with This Beetle!
Review:  After reading about all the problems on the New Beetle Convertible, I had to review mine.  After nearly 20,000 miles it's been flawless except for a turn signal issue that the dealer addressed.  Dealer told us to ALWAYS use the top cover or risk having the top torn away at highway speeds.

Title: Children are not importants... (VW)
Review:  Ok, I'm a french canadian and I will  get to the point about children  safety. This car is not legal in  Canada for children seat because it  doesn't permit the installation of a  top (third) point anchor. We learn  that after the purchase. VW said that  the car is equiped with LATCH system,  but it doesn't (the third point is not  there at the top.) For that, this car  should be 0/10. The children safety is  the top priority of any car builder. I  plan the get a lawyer until VW find a  solution. I will go to the media. For  the rest of the the car itself, it is  very good.

Title: Problematic bug, unhelpful dealers
Review:  My bug has had many recurring problems  from the day I took delivery. I have  had problems with the roof mechanism,  the rear lights (both turn signals and  brake lights) and the passenger-side  window, which shoots back down when  the window is raised. I have asked VW  to buy the car back as a lemon. I have  taken the car to two dealers for  warranty work, neither of whom are  particularly helpful. I never got a  call from the dealer advising me that  an ordered part arrived - I always  have to call them. When the car itself  was on order it was the same. I  not buy VW again.

Title: Happy Fat Man
Review:  Our Beetle is a 2003 Convertible GLS  with leather and a six-speed automatic.  This past Fall my wife and I took our  2003 Beetle Convertible on an 18 day,  5000 mile excursion to Yellowstone, the  Grand Canyon and most points in  between.  We packed a week's change of  clothes for warm and cool weather, plus  a cooler packed with drinks, food, and  cameras, ect.  NO PROBLEM!!  I am a big, big man, pushing 400lbs.  Yet we were both very comfortable and  the car performed without flaw. Let me  tell you...there is nothing like the  Rockies in a rag-top!!

Title: window problems
Review:  i have owned new cars for over 30 yrs -  the new vw beetle convertable is the  most fun and best fitting car i have  owned.  it hugs the road and is  great on turns. unfortunetly i have had  it back to  the dealer 3 times for a rear window  problem - the dealer scratched the  inside panel and had to send it to the  body shop to be re-painted then buried  the metal clip to the seat belt inside  the panel!  while i am love my car, i am very  unhappy about it spending so much time  in the shop for  these "annoyances"(4times total in 6  months) i have always owned new cars in order  to avoid these problems.

Review:  I have owned my aquarius blue  convertible for 5 months now. I love  the car. It is fun to drive, people  notice you, young and old love this  car. I had problems with my air bag  light that won't go off and windows  that will not go back up under the  convertible top. It has been to the  service dept several times for these  problems. They are happening less  frequent now. My dealership and service  advisor have been great. They bend over  backwards to please me. I finally broke  the 30 mpg barrier after 4500  miles.These are little problems people  have. This car is great to drive!! Oh,  by the way, this is my 3rd VW and I  will continue to buy them.

Title: not baby friendly but still good.
Review:  Beetle is a very good car overall, with  only a few annoying quirks. The ride is  sporty, yet supple where it needs to  be. Very easy to control. Just try to  get it on 3 wheels or to spin out of  control...it ain't easy. Braking is top  of the line & out performs most  Japanese cars & many domestics. No one  can match the headroom, not even a  truck,unless your in a convertible.  Power  windows,locks,alarm,sideairbags,heated  seats,etc are standard. It has an  excellent safety record too. Beetle has  a solid feel to it.

Title: Love it, but had a big problem
Review:  Amazing engineering and design for  such a small car, lots of fun to  drive.  Turbo has a lot of power, but  lags when starting from dead stop.  I  had a BMW 325is, and this car drives a  lot like it.  For the $, I don't think  you can beat it, especially if you're  looking for a four seater  convertible.    But....  I had a defective slave  cylinder that caused the clutch to  burn up after 3300 miles, and the car  broke down on the NJ Turnpike.   Warranty covered it, it's all fixed  and working great, but I have to  question reliability when I break down  so soon.

The tiptronic is a fun way to speed up for merging and the S or Sport Mode is nice for country drives.

Title: A Breath of Fresh Air
Review:  Shortly after purchasing my bug, I made  plans to drive from Chicago to  California. A solo trip with diversions  north and south of the direct route. I  travelled through 13 states, through  many twisting mountain passes and  boiling deserts, and this car was  atreat to drive!  Tight turns on  hairpin corners-she held at three times  the recommended speed.    National  parks with a 360 degree view with the  top down! Close enough to pet the  buffalo at Custer State Park in SD. My  bug handled the snow and off road  terrain at Crazy Horse Monument.  My  6CD changer and Monsoon sound system  blasted and relieved other drivers from  my questionable singing voice.

Title: Not suited to the weaker sex
Review:  The convertible top is the reason to  buy but it is not easy to use. The handle to pull and latch the top is  hard for a woman to use. Likewise when the top is down the cover  boot for the top is required to be in  place and it too is difficult to latch. The cover boot was replaced for a  better fit but still suffers from  difficulty to push the latches into the  locking slots. Dealer suggestion to place the boot  cover on while heated up is a joke!

Title: A lemon in the making???
Review:  After the long wait for the Convertible  Bug.  You would think that they could  get the top right!  I mean afterall the  car is approaching 30K and yes its a  BUG! I purchased this car in April 03.   Since then the car has been in for  service 4 times.  From the top  jamming/breaking, to the Transmition  and tiptronic failing.   THis car has  been a nightmare. VW service and parts  is a total disaster. They dont even  carry as much as a cigarette lighter  that isnt on back order.  It was so  exciting to get this car only to be a  great disappointment. you  might spend more time with a service  rental.. then your own vehicle.
