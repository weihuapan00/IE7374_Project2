THIS IS A PROBLEM! I tell everyone I see when I am at the dealership, I tell everyone that ever asks me about it. The guy in the parts department even agreed with me: ""Yeah, I have never heard of a car having that many problems in that combination."" ",1.375

Yes it's fun to drive, great to put the top down, and yes its cute- however when I went to trade it in- it turns out that a dealer buy back = LEMON in the car world.  Thus- hideous trade in value.  Shame on you Annapolis Smart- Mercedes.  Buy back = Lemon- run don't walk from the 2008- check the title history, if you see dealer buy back look elsewhere unless you plan on keeping it forever.",3.125
3, on 11/04/10 00:00 AM (PDT),Tom Lavender ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Ideal Key West Car!," I have a very early 2008 Passion Cabrio.  Really enjoy the car, but it's 150 miles to the dealer.  Have had many driveability problems.  It took Smart 2 1/2 years to figure what the backup problem was.  I had cruise control installed, the dealer blamed the backup problem on the cruise.  I had the cruise uninstalled still had the problem. I truly love the car but just don't understand Smarts logic as to marketing and service.  I'm out of warranty and ready to trade cars Smart Weston acts like they don't want my car back. It is a wonderful car, would be even better if the dealer wasn't 150 miles away.  They need better warranty and better service centers.   ",3.375
4, on 10/21/10 00:00 AM (PDT),michael ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Lies and and verbal promises, We were one of the first people (71/72nd) in Florida to buy this car 28 months ago. We bought the convertible with all the extras 24k total from the start we started having mechanical problems. We also bought an extended warranty $1400. Time after time the car was having to be towed and it wasn't just one thing. It was the shifter twice the engine twice the a/c and it goes on and on. The car is now broke and sitting in our yard with 30k miles. The warranty doesn't cover transporting the car after 24k. This was after a sales person assured us the if anything go wrong including the tires for 70k miles it will be towed and fixed at no cost.,1.875
5, on 09/13/10 00:00 AM (PDT),Alan Griff ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Two Year Update," After two years, the honeymoon is over, but the marriage is still good.  I adapted to the fussy transmission.  A relaxed driving style works wonders. The ride actually improved with time.  Winter driving is okay, but winter parking after a snowstorm is painful because the smart is so light.  In the Summer, the AC occasionally blows hot air or the fan stops, and this is after the fan was replaced, a popular warranty fix, I've been told.  The driver side airbag cover popped a bit.  Unsightly.  But that's the extent of the bad stuff.  Overall, the smart is still mostly a pleasure.  I'm 5'9"" weigh in the high 200s and the car is comfortable and easy to enter and exit.

Everywhere I go people stop and ask questions about this car. Some have even asked to sit in it or take pictures. I let my wife drive it sometimes and when she's leaving I am thinking ""Boy that thing is small"", but when you are inside, it seems much bigger, headroom and legroom is no problem, the ride is a bit bumpy, and the trans is something you either get used to or you don't like it. As far as power goes, I have no problem getting up to speed to enter the expressways, and I have had my car up to 85 mph with no problems. You do get tossed around abit when a semi-truck passes by though.",3.625
7, on 05/09/10 13:58 PM (PDT),bikerchick3 ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Not What I Was Expecting," Rides horribly. Faulty transmission has left me stranded a couple of times and the dealership won't do anything about it. original battery was ""bad"" and left me stranded, but they replaced it. Gas mileage in the city is only ~25 mpg., much less than I was expecting. ",2.625
8, on 02/09/10 17:43 PM (PST),Belva Hinthorn ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),2 years and still loving my Smart," I reviewed my Smart 2 years ago just after purchase. 2 years, 10,500 miles later I still love driving it and besides gas, 2 maintenance visits, an armrest I just had installed, and an accessory for the back ""trunk"" for covered storage, I haven't put an extra dime into it.  It still looks like new and is even more fun to drive. On my recent oil change visit, they made the upgrade on the transmission and installed a free battery (due to ? recall)so I'm good for another 5000 miles.It is even peppier now than before the upgrade. I have never regretted buying my Smart and hope to keep it forever. It still gets smiles from other drivers. The only reason to trade it would be for an electric model.",4.875
9, on 06/19/09 03:15 AM (PDT),D. Martin ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),This is such a cool car~!," I am a college student who wanted an inexpensive car to get to and from school. This car is so fun to drive, especially with the top rolled down. It gets many stares and many questions. I love everything about it!  Obviously this car isn't for everyone. Some people need trucks for work, but for many people like me, this two-seater is perfect. It holds everything I need for my classes and squeezes into tight places when I'm on the hunt for parking.  My family owns a Mini Cooper S, and although it leaves the Smart in the dust performance wise, the Smart, for me anyway, is much more entertaining to drive due to it's unique character.  Don't expect to be an Indy 500 racer in this car.",4.75
10, on 05/21/09 10:11 AM (PDT),Barbara Robinson ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),2008 Cabriolet," I love this car. Even though there is a jerky shift between 1st & 2nd gears, it's not that bad. The gas mileage has been great (38-45 mph). Most of my driving is around town but I have traveled on the highway. The space inside is surprisingly roomy. My husband and I are both tall and I have to pull the seat forward. The convertible allows you to fold partially or totally down.  I like that feature.

11, on 04/12/09 18:11 PM (PDT),Doublesmart ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Love My Smart Converitble," I drive 8 miles to work and around town generally but have made long distance trips on the freeway and found it no different than my large volvo as far as feeling secure in the driving experience.  For a 4 cylinder it has a lot of pick up.  I tend to put the pedal to the metal and I am not disappointed in its take off from a stop at intersections.  Of course, my driving style does mean that my fuel economy is not as good as what is advertised.  I get about 30 to 32 in town but 40 on the freeway over long distances.",4.875
12, on 04/03/09 07:17 AM (PDT),Alan Griff ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),smarter than you might think," Unlike shopping for other vehicles, in choosing a smart, you decide on what you don't need.  Do you need to chauffeur people?  Do you need to buy fuel frequently?  Do you need to spend time looking for a parking spot?  Do you need zippy acceleration?  Do you need trunk space that will hold more than a suitcase or two?  If you answered, ""No,"" to one or more questions, then the smart deserves consideration.  Yes, the ride can be poor to fair, but the very comfortable seats make up for a lot.  Yes, the transmission doesn't shift that smoothly, but it can be described kindly as ""easy going.""  It's okay in the city, and on the highway, once you're up to speed, does it really matter?  I love it.",4.5

Once a year service and oil change, quality construction and materials and a convertible with heated seats is a huge plus. ",5
15, on 12/13/08 18:53 PM (PST),T.E.Montecillo ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Smart Fortwo Passion Cabriolet.," I received my new Smart Fortwo Passion Cabriolet on October 26,2008. It was a warm and sunny afternoon (for Michigan) On my drive home from the dealership I reached 82 MPH on the freeway and felt comfortable and safe. Once at home I felt like a celebrity as many people approached me to ask me about my new car. In fact wherever I go people stop me to ask about the car. I always tell them that the car handles well in every weather situation I have encountered so far, I have been averaging 35.9 MPG, And my commute to work is 19 miles. Also I work in downtown Detroit and finding parking can be difficult at times. However I have been able to park cheaply or even free on many occasions. SMART USA ",4.625
16, on 12/04/08 12:35 PM (PST),gitlaw ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Fun to have your arrival announced," Wherever you go, you can hear people announce your arrival (""Smart car!"").  That aside, the car has unexpected power on the highway.  This car, like a small dog, doesn't know it's small. Love the convertible top, though, which can open and close at any speed.  Mercedes technology makes the car very quiet with the roof up compared to other convertibles (like the noisy Miata, for example).  You get used to the upshift from 1st to 3rd, although my spouse prefers to use the paddle shifters for a smoother transition.",5

My husband and I are neither one small people and we feel very comfortable in the car.   The only thing that is sometimes uncomfortable is that people always stare.  I feel like I am speeding all the time. ",5
18, on 11/15/08 14:58 PM (PST),Lexe Payne ,2008 smart fortwo Convertible passion cabrio 2dr Convertible (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Gouged by dealer of love car, I find out after the fact that the dealer misrepresented the cost of accessories and pocketed a lot of extra money. The car is wonderful to drive and is extremely comfortable and easy to get in and out of. The quality of the car is extremely good considering the cost. It is the old VW bug mentality with a 20th century need for speed and room and comfort.,4.875

I think it need fatter tires to soften the ride over rough areas, like rail road crossings, and pot holes, etc.  A speed control would be nice, too. Now take a look at the sun visors, too small & try turning them to the left, hmm, room inside is great,style is great, & I would love it more if the ride were smoother. I like the attention.

I was convinced that it would be hot in America. Now that I own the 'Americanized' version, it is clear - this car will be Hot in the USA. Solid, Reliable, Convenient, comfortable, practical, attractive, interesting, and it keeps up with the rest in a respectable way. Smart is here. Finally. A truly innovative car in the US market.   Once it starts marketing to the young crowd - look out. It's the next fad. Beyond the VW. ",4.5

Got about 42 MPG on the 1st tank, while showing a drop for the 2nd tank. Semi-auto tranny is somewhat abrupt. Engine is a bit noisy. Great highway stability at 50-65 MPH - did not feel any drift.

Minimal noise and sturdy drive. Due to the lighter weight of this car, you may feel the wind during a VERY windy stormy day, but not while passing semi's.

I am 6' 4"" and was concerned about fitting in a little car. I was extremely pleased with the tremendous amount of room in the cabin. My knees comfortably fit under the dash. My wife had to laugh once she got in. The ride with the top open is fantastic. I was amazed with the headroom with the top closed. The mileage has been terrific in town where I regularly get 41 mpg. I had to chuckle with my first fill up of 3 gallons after my 1st 130 miles. The car drives well on the highway and over distances. My foot got a little heavy on a highway and I opened it up to 95. It's a great commuter car and a ball on the weekends",4.5

I have never experienced less than 40 MPG in city and freeway driving. Poor Mileage. The upright seating is remarkable.  Tested a Honda Fit, the seating was low and uncomfortable.  Although not a high performance machine, it's very peppy even at freeway speeds. I was surprised at the space behind the seats with the two-way opening rear door lets you put even tall things in upright.  Electric top is great, with windows up it has minimal wind whipping around.  Very fun to drive.  Can go anywhere without people with questions, one person followed me home to ask about it.

We park the car in the drive way and strangers came up to us and wanted to see the car so we showed them the fun car and let them sit in it and they were all surprised how big it is inside and the seats are comfortable they like the color ( red and black trim). When you take the fun car anywhere be ready for extra time because people want to know everything about it. I love to drive it and my husband does to. I think everyone should test drive one.

I love this little buzzing bee!  I fold down my passenger seat for my service dog, a golden retriever and still have plenty of room to carry dog food and groceries!  People will gather round where ever we go.  Even have folks track along side to ask questions at stop lights and such.  The local TV station WTOV9 Wheeling/Stuebenville ran a piece on it.  They were driving by, spotted it in front of the house (I live right on old Route 40/ National Road) banged on my door and asked for a demo and interview.

It is fun to drive, comfortable for two large people, and provides a reason for all of those who see it on the road a reason to smile. We can fit groceries for a week for two in the back compartment, as long as it isn't a Costco trip with large bundles of paper and cleaning supplies.

It is worth every minute of the wait.  Fun, fuel efficient and cute as a lady bug.  The convertible feature is cool in that the top can be taken down or put up while driving at any speed.  The stereo is great for such a small car.  I put myself and a buddy, (both 200# plus) and accelerated 0 to 60 in two blocks, not bad for a care that gets 40 mpg in town and 50 hwy.

I was stuck in the mioddle of the road trying to figure out why I couldnt get it into gear, had to shut it off while on coming traffic had to slam on the brakes! Very scarey and very close call. I feel that this is a saftey issue. Smart car has done nothing about it and does not want to recall it. My car is the 2008 Smart for two. I think that most people that have this car have the same problem. To help this get resolved people have to get on safecar.Gov and make the report for complaint, so then it will be forced into recall. I believe that people may have tried to make the report but the safecar.gov wasnt easliy working for that make or model until I called them directly. I just want people to be safe and companies to own up to their products.

It is soooo annoying if you get stuck in traffic, Shifting from 1st to 2nd constantly up and down will make you want to vomit. This is the main reason I want too sell it.

130, on 09/13/15 10:59 AM (PDT),RB ,2015 smart fortwo Hatchback pure coupe 2dr Hatchback (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),WE WERE STUPID TO BUY A SMART!!!," We purchased the Smart fortwo thinking we will save money on gas and save on maintenance as the car is relatively simple compared with today's sophisticated vehicle standard. WRONG! The MPG is okay not comparable to other vehicles in the same or larger size range. The battery which is located under the passenger carpet died twice within the first 8K miles and by the time we accumulated 20K, we had to have the Smart towed to the dealer because it abruptly died in the middle of traffic and would not restart.The BIG SHOCK was the dealer's $15,000.00 estimate of repair... If you're thinking that the engine or transmission failed, you'd be wrong. According to the dealer, whoever replaced the battery the second time failed to properly ensure that a condensation hose that runs from the AC over the top on the battery and through the floor was reconnected properly. The condensation accumulated between the foam under the carpet and the metal floor, and shorted out the transmission module under the driver's seat and wiring harness. The carpet above never got wet so we had no clue this was occurring underneath.After further inspection, it was evident that the hose actually pops off by itself and it was more of a design failure than a battery installation error. Besides, is it SMART german engineering to run an AC condensation line with a pop off break directly over the battery?The $15,000.00 was a joke since you can almost buy a new  Smart for that. So we called Mercedes/Smart customer service for assistance and after a one month run-around, they offered nothing! Not even an acknowledgement that they have a design problem even though it's well documented on Smart Blogs.It is no wonder that the Smart Car made it on both Consumer Reports' Worst new cars of 2014 list and Edmunds The 17 Worst Cars You Can Buy. In fact, It's No.1 on Edmunds list with the subcaption ""Friends Don't Let Friends Buy These Vehicles""Save your money, don't be so dumb as to buy a Smart!",1

I wanted a small reliable car. So I decided to go with the smallest car out there with the Mercedes Benz reputation with car reliablity. I got my 2012 smartcar with only 10k miles. Great car at first. Oil changes were maintained well. I noticed the brakes went out fast. Every 8 months I needed new brakes. Then noticed my car wouldn't start regularly. Took it to the Mercedes dealership and found out I needed a whole new engine. Thank God for basic warranty. Which btw is 4 years or 50k miles. After I whole year of travels. My car had 19k miles. I never would have expected the engine needing replacement already. Uggh. So the dealership is taking care of it now. It's taking almost 2 weeks for ordering new parts. I asked the dealership how much it would be without the warranty and I almost died when I found out it would cost $14k for the new engine!!! That is way more then what I orginially paid for the car. Hope no one else gets any of my issues but please be adviced. I will trade in this bad boy as soon as I get it back from the dealership.,3

The cabin temperature controls are effective and the sound from the entertainment center is outstanding. The new tires and the highway operating sound level are greatly improved. All around vision from inside the cabin is good. The only thing I have found that I didn't like was the windshield wiper on the drivers side. Doesn't wipe good.

142, on 03/13/17 13:08 PM (PDT),Simply Blue ,2016 smart fortwo Hatchback prime 2dr Hatchback (.9L 3cyl Turbo 5M),Great Upgrade From 2012," *Update 2018:  I still love this car.  There have been no maintenance issues, and it has been fun and reliable to drive.  Since first writing this review, one of my best friends and a family member bought smart cars as well.  They liked my car so much that they wanted their own!I originally had a 2012 Smart Fortwo Pure, which was a great little car but with some very notable downsides.  To name a few, the old transmission was less than great, it was a tad cramped and the Pure in particular lacked some modern car features that I would have liked.  After hearing about the new transmission, cross-wind control and other slew of upgrades, I decided to check out the 2016.  A year later, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I always loved the size and city maneuverability of the Smart Car, but now that comes with a much more substantial vehicle.I purchased the automatic 6-speed dual clutch transmission, and though I would not call any Smart Car a speedster, the new transmission is much smoother.  The boost from the turbo is also a nice addition, making the car feel swift and zippy.  The car now has the speed it needs to pass other cars on the road with ease.  The cross-wind control also makes those windy days a non-issue, compared to the shaky windy day drives in the older model.The new headlights are bright and clear, with the fog-lights doing as desired in blizzard conditions or foggy weather.  Due to the narrow wheels and short wheel-base, I have never had any trouble in the snow, unless I blatantly drive into a pile that I know might bottom the little thing out.  Even then, I've never actually gotten completely stuck in snow drifts, though I don't consciously drive through anything that looks excessive to the eye.  The stability control does a good job at managing the rate at which the wheels are spinning, so you can pull out of slick spots.  As for the interior, the extra width makes a noticeable difference as well.  My dad is a large man, and he can sit in the new model without us feeling cramped in the slightest.The bluetooth on the stereo system is nice, and pairs well with the iPhone holding attachment on the entertainment system.  I opted for the model with the upgraded sound system, boasting 7 speakers and a little subwoofer.  I am pleased with the sound quality, and those riding along with me are impressed with the kick that the audio provides.  I should note that I do a lot of highway driving, so cruise control does a good job at maintaining MPG.  The 2016 also feels much more sure footed on the highways than the 2012 did.I wanted a peppy edgier looking small car for city driving and occasional long trips, and I feel like the new smart car has met all of my personal wants.  If you are in the market for a small car, this comes highly recommended by me.  The most glaring issues of the past models have been ironed out, and the Smart Fortwo has grown up to be something that more Americans will be pleased with.",5

I've replaced two light bulbs and a heater blower fan--the exact same one that went out on my Mercedes.  Bought it on ebay and took 20 minutes to install on the smart (just twisted in!)  You don't want to see the installation bill on the Mercedes.  I got every option I could order except rain sensing wipers.  If I knew how great they worked I would have bought those too.

My trip had many very steep hills, wind and even some mountain passes so I only averaged about 40MPG on that trip.  However, normally in my day to day life I get 49MPG!!  The USB is inconveniently located in the glove box.  And after having the car for a MONTH I just learned yesterday that the GAS FLAP locks when the car doors are locked!  So...in Oregon where they pump your gas for you (by law) they couldn't open the gas flap, but I had no idea why it was locked until finally I realized it's because the car doors were locked.  So...in order to open the gas flap to fill-up you have to use the car key to unlock the doors which also unlocks the gas flap.  There are a number of things about this car that are not ""explained"" in the owners manual (or not explained well), so I'm still figuring it out.  But it's a great little car.",4

Blakely ,2013 smart fortwo Hatchback pure coupe 2dr Hatchback (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Glad I did the smart thing," I bought a used 2013 Smart Fortwo with 27k miles on it from a Mercedes dealer.  Love this car.    I drive it 50 miles round trip daily to work averaging 38mpg.    At first I was skeptical about driving it at high speeds or in heavy traffic, but my experiences have been all good.     As with driving any car, I don't like having some idiot riding my tail when I'm going 70mph.On the inside the car doesn't really feel small.  It's narrower than most cars yes, but because the majority of the car is devoted to passenger space, there are no issues with leg room or head room, and I'm 6'1"" tall, 250lbs.    There is adequate space in the hatch for getting groceries or carrying a couple of suitcases.  I sometimes I forget I'm driving such a small car until I park, get out, and look back at it.  I've read other reviews complaining about the ride.    It's not a Lincoln Town Car, but I have no complaints.   I do try to avoid larger bumps and potholes to save wear and tear on the suspension and front end, but I do that with all of the cars I own. I've also read reviews complaining about the transmission.   No complaints from me though.  The transmission is an ""automatic manual"" transmission, with shifting controlled by a computer rather than my foot on a clutch pedal.   You can also shift manually if you want.   Either way, if you don't like the feeling of a manual transmission, you won't like the smart car.  Nuff said.The interior is not luxurious but it has all the amenities you would find on any mainstream car.Overall, driving the car reminds me a little of the old VW Beetle (1960's and 70's vintage) as both the VW and the smart are rear engine German cars.   The smart is about the same width or a little wider than the bug, but more comfortable.    The smart of course has all the electronic dash features as well as A/C and cruise.   The smart is also more fuel efficient than the VW was.   And the smart is much quieter; you can just hear the 1000cc Mitsubishi engine purring in the back.",4

The car has been more fun than I thought it would be to drive, but I agree with other posters that leaving it in pure auto mode results in a lousy ride.Even in 'manual' 1st to 2nd is a drag. The little engine does quickly lug out on hills and even slight inclines, but it drops seamlessly into 4th with an easy pull of the shift lever. Gas mileage so far better than advertised.Plenty of vertical room, but my legs end up jammed against the door and the shifter when it is in 'manual' mode.Along with the seats being uncomfortable, I am not looking forward to long trips.",3.875

Parking is a breeze in NYC where parking in anything larger than a smart is a nightmare. However, when the weather is below 35 degrees, the cabin is always cold (even with heated seats) and the heat robs 20-40% of your range if you use it consistently. The 70hp boost they claim rarely kicks in when you step on the pedal. I've had the car for 4 mo now (since Nov '13) and range anxiety has been a major problem during the polar vortex days.

I saved 3 years to purchase my car. I'm a senior and the paint is peeling off like crazy. It looks like a car someone got off a wrecking sight. I have taken impeccable care of my car, garage kept, washed with water only, no accident. I brought this to the attention of Mercedes and the smart headquarters to apply for their ""goodwill out of warranty process."" that's a joke. I was denied twice. I did nothing to cause the paint to peel off and they have denied my requests for them to paint the car or replace the panels as was recommended by their approved place to obtain an estimate to fix the problem. I am heartbroken about this. Yes, it's just a car, but as mentioned i saved a long time to get my car new, and in no way should the clear coat be peeling off the whole car. I have contacted Mercedes and smart and they clearly will not do what is ethical and right and that is to take care of the deficient paint job that was initially put on the car. So, i am using my first amendment rights and i have posted 2 signs on my smart ""buy a smart and watch the paint peel off in front of your eyes. smart/Mercedes will not fix this."" these people know darn well that the paint job on those cars were crappy at best, and i don't know how they can sleep knowing that the ethical and morale things to do is make it right. Paint my car. I am heart broken. A car i wanted so badly and saved so long for and it looks like crap. People who see my car are appalled but mostly shocked that smart/Mercedes won't make it right. Be careful when buying these cars. Maybe you'll be lucky with a good paint job. I woudln't risk it. It will cost $2800 to fix my car. I'm a senior on social security and i can't afford this, nor can i sell the car the way it looks. Be careful, and don't waste your time dealing with the dealership or headquarters. They just don't give a rat's behind. Their pat answer is, ""i'm sorry. The team has denied your request."" the goodwill out of warrant process is a joke. So, my only way to get people to be careful when purchasing their smarts is for me to ride around with my signs and get the word out there. Don't know how these people sleep at night.

Original owner lived in the city & bought it for his 17 yr. old.  After only a few weeks, she didn't feel safe driving it. We feel very safe.  We live in a Rural area, & have driven on the Interstates. We LOVE it!  As others have said, get use to having people wait outside in the parking lot to see who's driving it & asking questions.  The first time driving, Mom got 2 thumbs up from guys working on the road. The automanual shifting is indeed there with the jerking motion, but after driving for awhile now, we hardly notice it anymore.  Can't wait to put the top down. Love the heated seats. ",5

It is very comfortable and roomy in the inside, it keeps up with traffic on the highway, 65-70 feels pretty safe. I have not driven her in the snow yet, this will take some getting used to.

Here are some things you should know though-the ride is bouncy at times and firm, the fuel economy isn't as good as you think, in most places you cant park it nose-in into spaces,& the acceleration isnt good. But there are alot of positives- driving it is as fun as driving a gokart, it is spacious on the inside, it feels fine at 70mph on the freeway,& the you feel that the whole world is looking at you. Everywhere I go, I get asked questions like ""Is it safe?"", or ""Is that streetlegal?"" but you get used to the attention.

The vehicle is excellent for what it was designed for.  Any comments about the transmission being jerky is based on not knowing how to drive the car.  As for the hwy, if any one out there has driven a VW Van before, the Smart Car is much more stable.  If you do not like the buffeting from trucks, just roll down the windows and it will minimize it.  You can make the ride better by making the tires the same size all around and putting on the next size up in a soft snow tire.  Buying a used Smart Car for less than $7,000.00 is better than buying a motorcycle.  The only draw back is the support Mercedes gives these cars.  I am fortunate enough that I do my own maintenance.

Of course, being in love with this car, my comments to others include how it's a great little car for doing neighborhood chores but it also does well driving on the Interstate Hwy. in spite of its small stature.

I actually LOVE when it's time to find a parking space, since it can fit in leftover 1/2 spaces where other cars can't fit. If I ever switch to a full sized car, this is the #1 thing I will miss.	• Great gas mileage. Driving around town and running errands, I can usually go 2+ weeks on a tank.	• Gas fill-ups are quick and CHEAP.	• Can go longer between oil changes. Manual advises to use synthetic and go up to a year between changes.	• Great acceleration from complete stop.	• Surprisingly good handling in snow. Its rear wheel drive and the engine is in the rear, so that is good for traction in the snow. There have been a few occasions where I've driven to work in several inches of snow. I've never been stuck (knock on wood) or felt like my Smart was out of control.	• The car doesn’t use much electricity. I've left the headlights and dome lights on overnight and it has always started.	• No one volunteers me to be a taxi, or to use my vehicle to help them move. The not so swell:	• There is a perception of Smart cars not being real safe for regular freeway commutes. It doesn't 'feel' unsafe when I drive on freeways. It just doesn't give me the confidence and safe feeling I might have in a larger vehicle.	• It doesn't recover its speed once you're slowed down on steep uphill roads. Once you slow down on a hill, that is as fast as you're going.	• On uninterrupted driving over say, 60 miles, the engine gives off a slight burning smell. I don't know if mine has an issue or this is normal. It doesn’t seem to be a problem, but I try to avoid taking it on long trips often.	• It could use a 'wall' between the rear cargo area and seat backs. Unsecured items slide forward and fall under the seats.	• No spare tire/donut. The upside is that the tires are so small that I just carry a high psi hand pump (looks like a bicycle pump) in the cargo, which is sufficient to put enough air in the tire to drive it to a repair place.	• Its skinny-ness is great for parking, but when I take it through the automatic wash, only the driver side tires get washed. The tire wash on the passenger side misses the tires.	• National service franchises don't work with Smarts enough. There is usually confusion over where the engine is, and how to get to it. This resulted in one of them breaking the thumb lever off the rear cargo hatch.	• Not a huge selection of tires for this car. I found 2 brands, and only limited tire stores carry them.",5

The car is easy to maneuver, great to park. I like driving it in manual mode, where I can control the shifting and make it smoother. It  is good on auto but I prefer the manual specially since there is no clutch. The transmission does adapt to your driving style, specially during the break in period.",5
236, on 05/13/09 20:23 PM (PDT),Rater ,2009 smart fortwo Hatchback passion coupe 2dr Hatchback (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),It's ok," It drives like a jeep (hard and stiff) and is slow to accelerate. The brake pedal is uncomfortable. I use it to go to work where parking is an issue. This is the only reason I bought the car. In this respect it's great. I now compete with motorcycles. But in all other respects it is disappointing. Transmission is slow to shift, a/c not cold enough. Would I buy it again? Yes. Because of the parking issue I have no choice. If I didn't have to go to work and park I would not buy this car. ",3.5
237, on 05/13/09 09:20 AM (PDT),Bill T ,2009 smart fortwo Hatchback passion coupe 2dr Hatchback (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Great Car," I have more fun in this car then in any I have owned. It's responsive, comfortable and a joy. It is amazing to me how something that is so small can feel so big when you're in it. The transmission takes a bit to get used to, but as soon as you do, it works great. If you're looking for a race car, this ain't it, but if you want something to get you where you're going with a smile I'd say you don't have to look further. :-)",4.5
238, on 04/01/09 17:40 PM (PDT),Robert ,2009 smart fortwo Hatchback passion coupe 2dr Hatchback (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Smart 4 2," The car is so small on the outside yet roomy on the inside. Took delivery and drove 120 miles that day on US 101. The car handles very well at freeway speeds with minimal wind buffeting despite weighing 1800lbs. I have 160miles on it and have used about 4 gallons. Storage room is ample, but I would recommend the optional luggage area divider to keep items from coming forward during braking. Shifting is sluggish for an automatic but if you think of it as a manual without a clutch it seems fine. After driving a V8 Mustang for years the car accerlates slowly but it keeps up with freeway traffic without difficulty. Other reviews said the car was noisy, but I didn't notice any excess noise.",4.875

I had six requirements in buying a car, all of which were satisfied by this car: 1)buy new at less than 12 K, 2)increase in value rather than depreciate, 3)five star safety rating (and I saw the video of them smashing a smartcar into a brick wall at 70mph with virtually no damage to passenger compartment, 4)plenty of room on inside, especially head toom, 5) lots of pep, 6)good in snow, 7) good at high speed, 8)incredibly fun to drive. 9) I have averageed 41 mpg since purchase. Now, why can't we build a car like this in the U.S. so I can buy American? ",4.875
241, on 01/26/09 04:50 AM (PST),murphysullivan ,2009 smart fortwo Hatchback passion coupe 2dr Hatchback (1.0L 3cyl 5AM),Worth the wait!," We had to wait a very long year after placing our reservation for our smart - her name is Daphne. The only way you know you're driving a tiny car is when you get ready to park it. It has wonderful pep; great head-turning quotient - makes everybody smile; and is such fun to drive. We got caught in a heavy snow squall about a week ago and in no time we were driving in a couple of inches of snow (no snow tires) on curvy, hilly country roads. The car performed beautifully. We have ordered the aftermarket exhaust system  and are considering replacing the red body panels with yellow ones. Guess we could sell the red ones on eBay.",5
