0, on 12/14/05 20:47 PM (PST),Trisha ,1997 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,AWESOME CAR!," This is a fantastic car! Not only is it fun to drive, but it is a head turner. I have had more compliments on this car than I have had on any other car I have owned. I haven't had any major repairs on this car. It has been very dependable. I love driving it. It is red with the black roof & spoiler, which is very sharp. I haven't seen very many on the road, & when I take it in for oil changes, the mechanics tell me they have never seen one in such good condition. I will keep this car until it just won't go anymore. I now have 55,000 miles on it & expect to put a lot more miles on it before it dies. I was disappointed to hear that 1998 was the last year for this car.",5
1, on 12/04/05 00:04 AM (PST),Patricia ,1997 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,Awesome Car!," This car is the most fun car I have ever driven. I have never gotten stuck in the snow with this car. It handles the road wonderfully. It takes curves with ease. When I bought the car, it had 10,000 miles on it. Now it has 55,000 miles on it, & no problems. I will keep this car forever! I have never loved a car like I love my Eagle Talon Esi! This is truly an awesome car. I have had more compliments on this car than any other car I have had. It is definitely a head-turner. The black roof & spoiler & red body is a great color combination.",5
2, on 02/19/05 14:20 PM (PST),Paco ,1997 Eagle Talon Hatchback 2dr Hatchback,Not Bad.," Most people don't like these cars, thinkthey are not reliable. They arereliable, and a great platform forupgrades, they just require a littlemore maintenance then most other cars.All in all, these cars are great, i'm abig fan of DSM cars, and Talons havegreat stlying and performance. The 420aengine is a great platform for upgrades,including turbo.",4.25

4, on 12/23/03 00:00 AM (PST),Deelio ,1997 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,"Fun, Reliable Car", This was my first brand spankin' new car and it's been the best car that I have owned.  I have had no major problems with the car since the 6 years that I have owned it.  It could use a paint job but other than that  my car is still like new.  The car is very fun to drive and handles the road well.,4.75
5, on 12/02/03 00:00 AM (PST),D. Strickland ,1997 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,ESi," Car is fun to drive, most DSM vehicles have a oil burn problem. Runs good and has great gas mileage, about 22 mpg city.",4.625
6, on 05/07/03 00:00 AM (PDT),DR1665 ,1997 Eagle Talon Hatchback 2dr Hatchback,pocket rocket!," I have owned my Talon since it was new.  These cars are very driver-friendly and reliable.  YOU CAN BUY YOUR OWN TURBO FOR THEM AND MAKE MORE POWER WHILE PAYING LESS FOR INSURANCE.  If you would like to know more about these cars, there is web community called 2GNT full of owners who love their 2GNTs (second generation non-turbo) cars and can help you with any mod/repair for FREE!  Buy this car!  ",5

8, on 09/02/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Mitch'sTalon ,1997 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,One of the funnest cars to drive!, If you don't own one or have never driven one...then don't try to rate this car!  I have had more fun driving this car than any other car I have driven.  I'm tired of seeing Honda's supposedly being decked out just to attract attention.  This car turns heads without any modifications being needed!  This car handles like no car I have driven.,4.75
9, on 09/07/14 00:22 AM (PDT),mack_kenamond ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,18 years of fun," In case you didn't know, this car is virtually identical to the Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX.  This family of cars is known as ""DSM."" I ordered my 1997 TSi AWD in October, 1996.  It was my first new car.  I still own it and doubt I'll ever sell it.  I love this car!  It has 113k miles at this point (Sept. 2014).  The turbocharger let go at 80k miles (2006) and I took the opportunity to upgrade.  I discovered DSMtuners website at that point and, over the years, became a ""DSM Wiseman"".  I've done almost all of the  work on this car myself ever since.  The only issues I've had with this car in its 18 yr life have been the turbocharger and radiator hose.  I've ""rescued"" others in deep snow many times.",4.875
10, on 01/29/10 07:42 AM (PST),Mikek ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,Have to mod it," 97 talon tsi awd, Swapped a 1G (91) 6 bolt motor, Big FP T28 turbo, 750cc injectors, 95 eprom ecu and a chip, 3"" turbo back exhaust. Greddy FMIC, This car is a rocket!! I run 18psi on pump 91 and has 280whp! when i cruise at 80mph i get 37mpg. This car should have came this way stock. I Love this car, so much more rare then a GSX. If you can find one BUY IT!! ",5
11, on 11/24/06 10:18 AM (PST),DarkPhoenix ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,AWD Bliss," Being a previous owner of DSMs, this is by far the best one ever built. Not only is it a competent handling car in dry weather, it handles even better in inclement weather. It's a little loud at anything above 60mph, and there are a few rattles in the interior, but what do you expect for a 10 year old car. The turbo spools nice and quick, never leaving me itching for power. The ride is one of the best for a sport coupe of it's caliber. The fact that it can hang with cars costing thousands more, and still return excellent fuel economy, makes this a great car! ",4.625
12, on 06/12/05 17:43 PM (PDT),god ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,Talon tsi, Great car fun to drive fast as anything. Easy to put engine mods on for major hp gains. ,4.125
13, on 02/19/05 12:03 PM (PST),Stewart Gibb ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,Best Car I've Owned, I bought it after one drive because of the stability of the AWD and the mid range power.  I've gotten over 30mpg on the highway.  It gets it's best mileage at about 80. With the leather and all the options it is an elegant car that is always fun to drive. ,5
14, on 12/14/04 22:58 PM (PST),RjH ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,great car," This is an amazing car.  Minecrankwalked on me, but its getting fixedbecause I couldn't get rid of it.  Thisthing is kind of heavy, and you feel iton an autocross course.  It's prettyquick in a straight line and cornerswell, but in a slalom you can feel itsweight.  It is very comfortable to ridein (3 people and luggage, 5 hours toOcean City, nobody complained) and getsdecent gas mileage (about 28, hwy), butit drinks 93 octane.  This is a greatcar, aside from the crankwalk issue, andI've recommended the TSi AWD or EclipseGSX to several people.",4.125
15, on 04/16/04 00:00 AM (PDT),Richard M. ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,Excellent Performer/ minor flaws," Performance is great as is aftermarket support for this model, all weaknesses have been found researched and most corrected.DO NOT PUT CHEAP TIRES or SUPER SOFT RACE RUBBER on these cars, they do eat tires up with the AWD, heavy weight, and power. The turbo is a little too small for maximum performance at high RPM,however it is more than enough for any commute,and provides Jet Fighter like thrust at low speeds (15 -45 mph) in traffic for excellent passing.  about 30 mpg on highway at 80 mph",5
16, on 09/28/03 00:00 AM (PDT),Talia ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback,LOVE this car!!! :)," This car can kick it! I have the AWD turbo and LOVE the performance! I live in the mountains and love to test it out as I'm never disappointed. ;)   I was told when I bought it to take good care of it to avoid the previous years problems and have. I have not had ANY problems with this car yet.   You have to replace the tires more often because they're performance, therefore softer, but you CAN get an all season that will last longer.  It can also haul a totally full car load without difficulty.  The A/C does detract slightly from performance, but not much.",5
17, on 02/28/03 00:00 AM (PST),Sethsoccer ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,Get Insurance That Covers Towing," Fun car, not the fasted though. Off the line its fast. The car is just to darn heavy, about 4,000 lbs. And they call that a sports car, come on. The celica i have (GTS, 6-speed) only is 2,700 lbs. Celicas are alot faster FYI. But I miss my AWD thats why im getting a new Subaru Impreza WRX. Now thats a nice car. That only comes in at about 3,000 lbs.",3.25
18, on 02/17/03 00:00 AM (PST),irrelevant ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback,Get the turbo.," This car will rock your face off.  The most fun driving I've ever had is in this car.  But, you have to get a turbo-charged model.  The base models suck.",5
19, on 10/17/02 00:00 AM (PDT),james ossey ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,the best," all, this car is the best car  next to the dodge viper gts acr. i love both of them",5
20, on 10/14/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Mantas ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,97 Talon Tsi Turbo," Ok Negatives first.  Because its an AWD it weighs a lot, im not sure about edmunds, but in my car manual it says the car weighs close to 4000pounds. Second negative is that the body has some rust to it,. I mean  its a 97 and im planning on redoing the bottom of the car and the hatchback.. Other than that, so far my talon is a 9 out of 10. Looks are awesome and performance is phenominal. Eagle talon is 9.5 out of ten in my book.",4.75
21, on 08/08/02 00:00 AM (PDT),COOL ,1997 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback,this is the worst day of my life," Let me tell you a little story about the eagle talon..first I ""chased"" an ambulance and because it was a sports car, got my license taken away. Then when i went up to my weekly trip to the air force academy, the tires blew faster than a strong wind in a hurricane. These so called ""high performance"" tires...not so much. by the way, the radio for some reason broke and the only station that would come on was radio disney. last time I checked, this wasn't the coolest station around the block for the youth of america. It's like an ex boyfriend...untrustworthy, unreliable, and breaks at the first sign of difficulty.",1
22, on 05/03/15 20:05 PM (PDT),zombiemotors ,1998 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,Problems of age, Well I was given a 1998 Eagle Talon as a gift.  Always look a gift horse in the mouth.  Apparently the previous owner had drove it like he stole it.  It needed a rad hose which was not a problem or a great expense but it also needed a new front axle on the passenger side.  Easy change.  Normally but not with the Talon.  The axle was seized in the hub and as a result it had to be cut out and the hub had to also be replaced.  That came to $300 plus a lot of time.  Next I discovered that the front suspension was shot.  I could not buy the parts locally and had to use the internet to find them.  Also a part on the rear suspension was bent and I could not get it period.  Had to straighten it.  ,3.375
23, on 10/28/09 07:30 AM (PDT),johnie tyler ,1998 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,1998 eagle talon," i bought my 1998 talon esi almost two months ago, i love the interior design of the car don't really care for the gray interior i prefer the tan. the car is really reliable the only thing i done to mine is when i first bought it i changed the plugs, wires, oil, tranny filter, all new fluids, and replaced all hoses and belts. i have never has my car broke down on me yet.",5
24, on 09/10/08 20:03 PM (PDT),avril89lavigne ,1998 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,1998 Eagle Talon ESi," The car so far has done well. One common problem though, is the cracked head gasket (which is expensive to fix). My car has many extras so of course, there is more to go wrong. But so far, it's been a good car. ",4.625
25, on 02/22/03 00:00 AM (PST),Ulysses S. Grant ,1998 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,IIIIIIIII love it!, I love it! I love it! I love it!! Great ride.  No complaints,4.875
26, on 10/24/02 00:00 AM (PDT),James Zalin ,1998 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,Eagle talon 98, My eagle talon is one of the best cars I've owned to date. I love the style of it and comfort of the ride too. The performance for only having 140 horses under the hood is great. I'm very impressed and satisfied with my car. I only wish they wouldn't have stopped making them.,5
27, on 07/03/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Sandy Dunbar ,1998 Eagle Talon Hatchback ESi 2dr Hatchback,Good," The car is fine. However, the back spindle is damaged.",4.625
28, on 11/26/08 11:00 AM (PST),Bob's Garage ,1998 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,Belt Problems, Got this car about a year and a half ago and it's thrown the power steering belt 8 times and it's gotten to the point where I can't rely on the car to get from point a to point b.  Doesn't help that I had to replace the clutch 2 months after purchasing the car. Definitely would not buy another. ,4.375
29, on 10/31/08 03:16 AM (PDT),Al Simmons ,1998 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback,The Ultimate Eagle Talon - 1998 Model," I owned a 1992 Eagle Talon from '92-97 and have hated myself ever since for trading it in (family, big cars, no fun).  Never wanted another sports car (not a car dude, but LOVED the Talon styling -  especially the bump on the hood).  Talon always had more aggressive body styling than its 'twin', the Eclipse.  To make a long story short, recently I was in the market for a new car, and, just for fun, I Googled for the ultimate (style-wise) Talon - the 1998.  Found my dream car 100 miles away in NoCal, Turbo, Red, only 37,000 miles (!!!)  Had no idea how rare it was (only 4307 made!) - I bought it the next morning.  Driving is FUN AGAIN! It was like getting re-acquainted with an old friend.",4.875
30, on 04/21/03 00:00 AM (PDT),Tammara ,1998 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback,Encredible!, Talons are the greatest! They are the most fun to drive and one of the nicest looking cars! I wish that they were still being made today.,5
31, on 03/28/03 00:00 AM (PST),Kezer ,1998 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,Best Car Ever Owned!!!!," I bought this car with 72 000km on it. Ibought it because the km's were so low.With so little km's, there's nothingthat can go wrong with it. The AWDsystem is amazing!!!!! It has saved mefrom a few accidents (or at least REALLYclose calls). You'll appreciate the LSDif you drive in snow or bad weather likewe do lots up here in Canada. . If youare trying to buy one, look for one withkm's under 100 000 and with noperformance upgrades. Trust me TALON'sare great cars. To get this type ofperformance, looks and features, you'llhave to buy a BMW or Lexus. I ve ownedmany cars before and the TALON by fartops them all off!!! Buy one while youstill can. ",5

I suggest this car to everyone.",5
33, on 12/26/02 00:00 AM (PST),watercrit ,1998 Eagle Talon TSi TSi Turbo 2dr Hatchback AWD,Factory can't fix," Spitzer dodge (Lakewood), the dealer who Chysler insisted I keep taking the car to for repairs to their incompetent warranty work never did repair all the car problems. The anti-locks don't work again, they damaged the wiring harness causing additional problems, feul guage doesn't read correctly, etc. They couldn't even adjust the alternator belt. You could here it in the showroomwith the car parked in the street and the service manager insisted that was normal. Engine and handling are good. Brakes have been serviced twice due to rotor surface peeling away. ",4.125

It is a 98 and it had 135,000 miles on the odometer.  The car runs like new.  I have had few problems in the past 8,000 that would not be expected.  The clucth was giving me problems in the winter, but it is the factory clutch with 140k+ miles on it.  It had to go in the shop for a bad ball joint, but the part was on recall anyways and was replaced for free.  The only real problem i have encountered is the camshaft position sensor has gone bad and needs to be replaced.  This is only a $70 part, so not too bad, especially since the car has so many miles on it.  Very good purchase, Very FUN to drive.",5

I feel it is the most reliable car I have ever owned. 202,000 miles with regular maintenance. It does wear out front rotors quickly, I've replaced them 3 times. The only repair I have made is a new serpentine belt and a radiator. A/C has a slow leak but its nearly 10 years old. I love this car, it accelerates well, rides smooth and has plenty of interior room.",4.75
