1, on 08/25/12 11:39 AM (PDT),dbrooks22 ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CSE Turbo 4dr Hatchback,5yrs later," I wrote a review below in 2007.Since then, i have had to do only the water pump, which started leaking only after i power flushed the coolant.Really can't believe how solidly this car was built.I also have the auto and wish i had a stick shift.And my car was a NYC car for the first 50K of it's life.But these cars were built for cold weather... overbuilt really.Anyone who has not seen the Top Gear Saab Tribute from a few months ago should head over to Youtube right now.Saab really did build a better car.. a car to last for decades.It's a dam shame what happened to them.Their attention to every detail, the quality of construction, and pride in engineering are inspiring.",4
2, on 07/12/12 19:31 PM (PDT),joliver4 ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CSE Turbo 4dr Hatchback,As great in 2012 as it was in '97," I actually have the automatic, which I bought in the name of practicality because I live in Los Angeles and I sit in hours of traffic every week -- but since buying the car, I half-wish I had a stick because this car is so much fun to drive. Originally from MA, the car's undercarriage rusted significantly before I bought it, which has caused a dearth of minor(ish) problems. Though, in the car's defense, none that you wouldn't expect to see on a 17-year-old vehicle with mostly original equipment. I have taken it from 82K miles a couple of years ago to about 107K today without any major repairs. Build quality, especially where the interior is concerned, is a bit lacking.",4.5
3, on 06/06/09 11:08 AM (PDT),JT ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CS Turbo 4dr Hatchback,Best Car Ever," With a few miles short of 270,000 I can safely say this is the best car I have ever owned.  I bought this Saab new and have driven it 80-85% highway.  Highway mileage driving at 75+ MPH is 28/29, well beyond original rating.  I have put tires on it every 60-80K, oil every 5-6K, and exhaust systems every 70-90K.  Beyond these, only a fuel pump and two clutches and scheduled maintenance.  The best and still running like a top.",5
4, on 05/16/08 19:58 PM (PDT),JBR ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CSE Turbo 4dr Hatchback,97 saab," This has been one of the best cars that I've ever owned. Heavy enough to be safe on highways, steady enough to not even bounce when side-swiped, reasonable on fuel and the hatch back has been indispensable. I've loved this car. The 1st transmission failed at 49K, but it was replaced (free) with a re-built and we've had no problems. The gasket heads got a little leaky last year but we've got everything under control. I've made a few major repairs thru Saab which is costly but we wanted to be sure we weren't using poor replacement parts. We finished all minor repairs and tune ups at a good local service garage.

5, on 02/21/08 12:38 PM (PST),Telfair  ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CS Turbo 4dr Hatchback,1997 CS Automatic (modified) - Amazing!," I bought this car 1 yr ago for $2.5k. Since then I have put $3k into it: new motor mounts, Bilstein HD shocks, front bushings, new CV boots, a 3"" downpipe, 7"" wide wheels with 225/15 Dunlops, a Stage 3 ECU which converted the LPT to FPT and remapped the computer software.  The car was 170 Hp and handled well. Now it screams at 270 Hp, spins the wheels off the line and in 2d, goes from 50-85 mph in a snap, and can blow past any BMW, Lexus, etc, on the road.  I can throw it into corners like a sports car, and it never slips.  BUY THIS CAR! It can be turned into a monster! The 2.3l turbo can be tuned to over 400 Hp. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing",4.75
6, on 08/25/07 08:30 AM (PDT),Dbrooks ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CSE Turbo 4dr Hatchback,Solid," I went from a Porsche 911 into this car, so I was a bit dismayed at the boat-like handling at first.  But I have owned it now for almost 2 yrs and haven't had to do anything other than change fluids.  Saab has built a vault- like car here, and it has more space than most of my friend's SUVs with much better fuel economy.  I'm not crazy about the styling and handling, but it has plenty of power, especially down low in the torque band.  The car does 0-30 faster than my girlfriend's Subaru WRX.  These cars are just incredible value for the dollar.  The car cost more than 40K new in 1997, and I bought it for 5K in 2005.  ",4.125
7, on 04/17/07 16:48 PM (PDT),sully ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CS Turbo 4dr Hatchback,Awesome," I've owned my 9000cs for 1 year. The car has been great. I drove it from Boston to San Diego to Albuquerque to Mexico and back to Albuquerque. It was a very comfortable ride with no problems. The fuel is awesome with cruise control on.  Maintenance: new rotors and brakes. New battery. New hub and bearing both sides. New outer boot and halfshaft both sides (if you're changing the outer boot, also change the halfshaft. You can get that in one piece.) I did the work myself. Saved around a thousand. The first side is hard but the second one is a breeze because you know how to do it at that point. I wanted to do the whole front end over. Next I am going to put in new engine mounts. Easy!! ",4.875
8, on 06/30/04 00:00 AM (PDT),dmsj ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CSE Turbo 4dr Hatchback,The true SUV," I absolutley love my 9000CSE. This car is the ultimate highway monster: it criuses effortlessly at 80mph and still gets 30mpg. When the time comes to overtake at highway speeds, look out, boost kicks in and you will be in triple digit speeds without even tring. This car can haul more then my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee and is much more comfotable. Because of this, we use the SAAB for out of town camping trips and leave the Jeep in the garage.",4.625

13, on 07/19/02 00:00 AM (PDT),C. LaBianco ,1997 Saab 9000 Hatchback CSE Turbo 4dr Hatchback,Great entry car to the world of sedans," Bought the car as a time to grow up upgrade from my wife's Pontiac Sunfire GT convertable.  First comment is that it is huge, seats 5 adults no problem. 2.3 ltr turbo is quiet but powerful, and the overall road handling is great. A bit of a gass gossler and loaded with lots of electronic gizmos that all seem to need service at 60,000 miles.  The car is a bit expensive for upkeep - but a real pleasure on road trips.  A far better value than a BMW 3 series probably more spacious than a 5 series. A great first time buyers entry in to the near/luxury sedan market.  Buy the car, drive it, enjoy it and worry about the rest later.",4.5

And great cargo space.You can rebuild the entire car fro under 10000. Maintain oil changes at 2500 miles and automatic trans at 30000 (Synthetic) and you can see 300000 miles.",5

19, on 10/13/07 12:50 PM (PDT),Ryan ,1997 Saab 9000 Aero Aero Turbo 4dr Hatchback,Multi-use Monster," To preface, let me state that I am a young male with strong inclinations for driving at a spirited pace on mountain roads at night. Knowing this, you may better relate my values to yours. The handling is fantastic. Everytime I test its limits, I'm always surprised. The acceleration is quick, and solid uphill. Repairs have been minimal. Comfortable for distances.The cargo space is more than enough. I've fit all of my camping equipment in this car (tent too). I can also comfortably fit my upright bass. As for aesthetics, the interior is dated, though still nice. No glovebox, but door pockets + pouch in passenger leg area are ample. Exterior is old, but I happen to like 80s design.",4.5

I knew I wanted something that looked good (inside and out), comfortable, roomy,  good gas mileage while at the same time providing great performance. After everything was said and done I was driving away in my  '97 aero and I didnt have to break my bank either. I love the acceleration but i cant wait to add some upgrades for performance, (blow out valve, intake, and manual boost controller. expecting~250hp!)     What more could you ask for.   ",4.875
21, on 10/03/05 13:12 PM (PDT),Karl K ,1997 Saab 9000 Aero Aero Turbo 4dr Hatchback,1997 Saab Aero Review," I purchased this used car as my everyday driver after my wife bought a 2003 Audi A6 2.7T.  I paid top dollar for the car as it was in excellent condition. Required repairs for the car were minimal (at purchase, $440, including fluid changes, and shift shaft fixes).  Since then, repairs and maintenance included new mufflers, oil and filters, a set of tires, wiper washer bottle, antenna, engine accessory belt, extra keys, alignment, light bulbs and brake pads, all told probably about $2400. The alignment probably should have been done at purchase. Accident repair was $808 from a pickup backing into the rear in a parking lot.",4.75
22, on 06/08/05 14:02 PM (PDT),Gary ,1997 Saab 9000 Aero Aero Turbo 4dr Hatchback,'97 Aero - Perfect," The best combination of power, comfort, and fuel economy you can get in a car.  I enjoy 35+ mpg on the freeway and better than 24 mpg in town yet the car is faster than most other sedans and even some 2-seaters.  The seats are superbly comfortable, the controls well laid out.  The only possible knock on the car is the lack of a proper glove box and cupholders (for those who care about cups).  Barring some unforeseen event, I plan to drive this car for 20 more years!  It is truly awesome.",5

It always has been very satisfactory. Unfortunately Saab stopped producing this great concept in the year I bought it. I can´t imagine trading it in for a nowadays car. The Audi A8 Avant showcar was quite nice, but I heard they won´t take it in production. Maybe the VW Touareg would be a convincing alternative. Nevertheless: A reassuring thought that this car will probably run for many many years.",5
26, on 04/07/03 00:00 AM (PDT),robh19 ,1998 Saab 9000 Hatchback CSE Turbo 4dr Hatchback,The last 9000 - fun and practical," We bought the 98 9000 off lease as we needed a bigger car.  Heard alot about 9000s and got a good deal.  The car, minus some expensive trips to the mechanic for routine maintenance (Typical, I found, for this car) has been great.  Fast, handles well, hauls everything in the world - incredibly versatile, something most euro-sedans are NOT these days (you get it THEIR way only).  Plus, it comes optioned-out only, so there's no picking and choosing (like the BMW and Audi), which helps hold the cost down on initial purchase.",4

No problems so far after 6 months of ownership.  I'm just recently finding out that the heated seats get perfectly warm very fast, and I love that they're paired with cloth upholstery.  I've gone through 4 cars in the past 2 years and this is certainly the most satisfying.  The sound system is horrible, and the heat and air can't really be turned up to a very high max (important for super hot and cold days).",4.375

Albeit a quick way for Saab to get an AWD to market, it still leans heavily towards Fuji Heavy Industries.  Ironic that both companies originally made aircraft.  Saab's adjustment to the exterior, gearing, steering, and suspension definitely paid off.  It's handling was excellent.  It loved to be pushed and responded well to pinning it centripetally into corners with acceleration.  On the other hand, it was loud and the interior was most definitely Subaru.  After professionally soundproofing all 4 doors, it was still noisy.  ",4.375

I may have had an exception but even my friends who drive Subarus discribe their experience differently. My 9-2X had a very annoying gear hum that over shadowed any other good qualites. The auto transmission was 20 years behind the times in techno. At low speeds it seemed to always be looking for the right gear. GM has has acted wisely in dropping this model from the future Saab line up. I have followed their lead and traded it after only 1 month. ,3.375

They both get relatively similar mileage, but the aero takes premium. Aside from that the car is a dream. Though the engine does lag a bit when the petals fully down, this thing is quick. The ""cock-pit"" flawlessly integrates the driver into the vehicle. The most attractive feature is the suspension. The car glides silently and smoothly over any road abnormality. Its a clean, simple, beautiful automobile. Quirky and different it may be, but its solid and practical as well. I look forward to errands... 'nough said.",4.75

The AWD performs well in the snow but soft-roading is made a little more exciting by the vehicles light weight and lack of stability control. In deep mud and snow I have never felt at threat of getting stuck.  Overall it is fun to drive and inspires confidence.  The 9-2x has all the cargo space and flexibility of a compact suv but feels adequate rather not ample in passenger space. This car would  not likely be optimal as a family hauler for more than 4.   The interior is sporty if austere and I found  that Subaru after-market parts helped round out the options and upgrades. The leather helps solidify the upscale feel,3.75

The AWD and turbo make city drivng fun with it's quickness and cornering abilities.   Having traded in a muscle car that was killing me in gas it has been a lot easier on the wallet at fillup time. Not as great as I expected (about 20 MPG avg.) but that is probably a combination of driving it in a fun manner and the city driving.  With two kids it has also been easier having a four door vehicle but keeping a sporty look and feel.,4.375

It's sporty and powerful enough to stay entertaining for years.  I really enjoy the on boost power, but there's not much low end torque.  Handling is good enough for the street, but it's not really at home on the racetrack. Mine is still completely stock, and has been incredibly reliable.  I've got almost 180k miles on it, and have only had a few repairs in all that time. I really like how practical it is.

I bought it way back when they had the GM employee discount for everybody. So I bought it instead of the Subaru Impreza.the mileage is over 266,000 miles and she keeps on ticking. I makes sure she is dealer tuned every year and I change the oil every 5,000 miles. I've had the rear struts changed. Right as I type this i have her in the shop. I busted three Lug Studs on the left driver rear hub while driving. While i was checking the proper torque on the other lugs, I busted another stud on the front left hub.

I immediately fell in love and still miss her to this day.I had Eleanor for almost 3 years. She gave me no problems and put nothing but smiles on my face while I owned her. It was worth the expensive insurance, premium fuel and lackluster mpg.Unfortunately, the engine decided to blow at 57,000K with regularly scheduled maintenance. Thousands of dollars later it just wasn't the same and was forced to trade her in.I gave Subaru another chance and traded Eleanor in for '11 Legacy in May 2011.",4.625

The AWD is fantastic in inclement weather and handling and highway ride is impressive.  My chief complaint is the performance of the automatic transmission.  It tends to be sluggish around town and slow to kick down, especially from third gear.  Family requirements necessitated an automatic, but I'd recommend the 5spd manual.

But it's not all practicality: being a WRX, it's ready to play whenever. Put the tach above 3500 and it hisses, growls, and rips a hole in time.

So the 9-2X gives me two extra doors i will never need for hauling the two of us to the park, skiing, or on a weekend trip.

Saab has been known for hatchbacks, which, following the introduction of the 93 sport sedan, disappeared from the lineup. Enter the 92x. Basically a reskined Subie Impreza/Wrx, with some cabin quieting. The exterior looks more saab-like than the swedish made 93 sedan. And with the GM discount, it's cheaper than the Subaru.

The 9-2x Aero combines the practicality of a wagon (great for carting small- to medium-sized dogs, for example, or camping gear), the thrills of a turbo engine (it will put a silly grin on your face that you cannot wipe off), and the safety of all-wheel-drive with ABS and a limited slip differential. The turbo characteristics have been refined, so you won't necessarily take off like a Tasmanian devil at 3000RPM. The shifter is notchy and can definitely be improved. Seats are decent, and the two-tone interior is nice. Road noise is acceptable, but more than the Jetta I owned. In all, a practical car that spells F-U-N.",4.625

We thought the car would be a good value for the price ($8999 before taxes.)

Great! We test drove it, and fell in love with the luxury of the seats, the sun roof, the Boise surround sound system (super awesome sound system,) and the Turbo pick up and go. We loved it! After our purchase, things started falling apart. The headlights started going out, the circuit to the headlights started separating from the circuit board and had to be re-soldered on. By 98,000 miles, the car started idling rough. No sooner did that occur, then the car completely died while my husband was driving on the freeway!! He was able to eventually get the car to start again and drive off of the freeway, only to have it die again on the street. We called AAA, and by the time the tow truck arrived, the battery completely died out. We got it to a mechanic, who recommended a new transmission. Our dealer was able to locate a refurbished transmission with a 6 month warranty, and $1600 later, the car's check engine light pops back on.

I am a slender 170lbs yet the cushion bottom on my leather ventilated sport-seats has gone nearly flat and I am sitting on the frame.  Dealership said they fixed it by putting a new one in (and billing Saab no doubt) but I believe they simply turned it over and puffed it out.  Bad for the back - and that is one of the reasons I bought my second Saab 9-5.  The rattles on this car KILL me.  The plastics are low-grade economy plastics and there are more rattles in this new design than there were in the older vehicle.  These new vintages suffer from shoddier plastics--Saab says 1 yr on rattles-bs!,4

From the Saab 900 to this current model - the 9-5 sedan. This is the best built and best handling Saab I have ever owned. The GM marriage seems to have improved overall quality in several key areas; climate control for one - now first rate quality. This car is roomy, responsive and fun to drive. The Front wheel drive and traction control make this vehicle exceptional in snow and winter driving conditions.

The roof, body, upholstery, front panel, and doors trim rattling and noises are getting intolerable with adding passengers; giving the impression the car will loose pieces or break apart.

For me, there's no other car out right now that provides the same balance of value, performance, COMFORT, fuel economy and style.  The 9-5 in Sport Mode makes any trip fun, as when you stomp on the gas the car just squats down and launches.  A warning, though, 75 mph feels like about 50 so make sure to set the cruise.  I also love the fact that I can haul 3 other adults on long road trips and get nothing but compliments on the interior comfort. Passengers especially love the heated rear seats in the winter.  ",5

I now have 10,000 miles and zero problems. The 9-5 may not be the most modern car on the road but I think the long production run has given Saab a chance to refine the platform and fix a lot of early production issues.

Comfy and easy to use interior that is great for traveling even long distances with 4 people.  Great performance - it's scary how much pull this engine has.  Floor it to 80 mph and it feels like the 9-5 isn't even breathing hard, plus you feel like you're only traveling about 55 mph!

Even the electric door locks have a reassuring thunk that makes me think of a deadbolt engaging dorr jamb. I often see mention of turbo lag. Please explain how a 2.3 liter 4 cyl automatic in a 3600 lb car can chirp the tires on full throttle takeoff if there is turbo lag. I take my foot off the brake, nail it, it chirps and the traction control kicks in. If there is lag it's in milliseconds. I don't need 6 cylinders and I am getting 23 mpg around town. ",4.875

Good news is that the car is largely unchanged in handling and ride. Braking and headlights are superior.  Yet the 2.3L four is much rougher than the old V-6, with noticable turbo-lag and torque steer. The updated dash is improved, but Saab uses cheaper materials inside, below prior quality.

The competition is more refined in most areas, but cant compete with the overall value (at least $100 less per month than competition).  I preferred the manual to the automatic version of 9-5 Saab, as the manual is more in tune with the road, with less front torque pull.

I have owned several Saabs, and this 9-5 drove as good or better then all of them. Saabs are known for their torque, and the new 2.3 turbo was strong from second gear on up (first gear was weak). Unfortunately, there is still torque steer under hard acceleration (negative of front wheel drive cars). Seats were very supported and comfortable, stereo was very good, it shifted smoothly, and handled well. If Saab made this all wheel drive, they would have an awesome car to compete with the best from Europe, the front wheel drive on this car stops it from measurng up to other sport sedans.

With all its gadgetry, I've already had my share of glitches, most notably poor performing rain-sensing wipers, a result of a poor sensor.  Various electrical gremlins also pop up on occasion, but are mild irritants at worst. The 9-5 in Aero guise is a great looking and oddly rare car in the sea of Bimmers, Lexii, and Benz that swarm the roads of Atlanta.

Today, check engine light came on, a week after getting it back from the shop. Typical story. In the car's defense, a lot of the trips are due to dealership/mechanic incompetence, but isn't that part of the package?

It's a great ""everyday"" driving car, and the turbocharged Inline-4 can make accelerating and passing folks a blast. Some people know about Saab's dedication to safety, and this car is no exception. It comes standard with plenty of airbags for everyone, very comfy seats with advanced seat belt restraints and safety systems, and a parking assist system that is optional on each 9-5 model. As for reliability, I have had no major issues (knock on wood), just a few normal maintenance items here and there. A list is provided below. (I would highly suggest only buying OEM replacement parts - 3rd Party Parts will generally last less than 1/3 of the time listed below) [*WARNING*: These are ONLY estimates and with NO labor included unless noted] FULL Synthetic Oil Changes (Every 6K Miles @ $40)Coolant Bypass Valve (Every 40K Miles @ $20)Gas Cap (Every 50K Miles @ $20)Automatic Transmission Fluid (3309 ATF) (Every 60K Miles @ $60)Direct Ignition Cassette and new Spark Plugs (Every 60-80K Miles @ $450)Crankshaft Postiion Sensor (Every 80K Miles @ $80)Throttle Body Assembly (Every 100K Miles @ $550)Tires are around $780 (alignment and labor included) for decent all-season tires (235/45R17) (Every 40K Miles)ESTIMATED TOTAL Maintenance Per 100K Miles = $3,420-$5,000 These are the replacements I've done myself so far but I know I will NEED to replace the fuel pump around 100K Miles ($900 plus labor). These replacements and the overall preventative maintenance for the 9-5 car are quite inexpensive in the long run compared to other automobiles (especially the German type). The most important thing to remember is that the Trionic 7 Engine Management System is one of the most advanced EMS ever developed, so you will know exactly what you need fixed if/when the Engine Light comes on. The instrument display and entire car also has few ""Saabish"" (neat) items to show off.  I am proud to say that I own and drive a Saab, especially a Saab 9-5.",4

The only problem is that such a comparison doesn't take into consideration that those cars cost at least $20-30k more when you start factoring comparable extras. In its price class the Saab 9-5 is simply the best value offering sporty power and handling, great comfort (seats + interior roominess), decent gas mileage and a unique design.  Really this car is equal parts fun and functional.  While the 2.3L turbo takes you 0-60mph in 6.7s, what is really impressive is how it performs in its unique power band (40-70mph).

Great decision on my part. I thoroughly checked out all the so-called competition and I felt the Saab wagon 9-5 won hands down. The lower cost vehicles just didn't compare and the higher cost vehicles didn't have anywhere near enough added value in order to justify the substantial extra cost. One might say that all wheel drive is a must, but I find the front wheel drive is just fine and you benefit from added gas mileage as well. I'm extremely pleased with the car overall.

On the downside, the center digital instrument display always had problems with dead pixels.  Had it replaced and same problem.

373, on 02/22/16 08:43 AM (PST),Richard ,2001 Saab 9-5 Wagon SE V6t 4dr Wagon (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 4A),Don't Bother - These things are money pits," I should have looked further into that price (why does a car with this many nice features and such good driving cost so little) before buying...The cost for the timing belt, which must be replaced every 80k, is over $1k at the repair shop. If allowed to go to failure, it will destroy the entire V6 engine...  Don't buy one of these with a V6 engine.I spend, on average, about $2.5k each year just replacing things that break so I can keep my car on the road.  I'm saving to replace it, but I keep draining my savings to fix it so I can get to work again.I bought mine used.  I've had this particular car now for almost 6 years & 100k miles (bought at 95k miles, now at 195k miles).Here are the things I've had to replace on my car during that time:Radiator, Both Radiator Hoses (separate repairs for all 3, one radiator hose failure left me stranded on the side of the road without coolant.)Ignition coils and spark plugs (that almost left me stranded, I knew they were failing but I had to wait a week for the parts to come in)Idler pulley (This one was replaced twice, did the first time during the timing belt change at 120k miles, the second one almost stranded me as I saw it bouncing down the road while I was driving to my repair shop).Water pump (also done during the timing belt, glad I got a 2-for-1 on that one - total cost was $1200 for that repair bill).Alternator (over $1k for that one, and it took time to come into the 'Saab' specialist shop)Turbo (That was $2k on its own, ouch!)Front and rear shocks/strut dampers.Power steering hoses and reservoir.Speakers (2 had the foam to fail, I found a speaker repair shop that got them back to working for less than $100 total).Air Conditioner Controller Motors under the dash, x2. (The first one failed so it was blowing cold during the Winter. The second one failed so it was stuck blowing the defogger onto the windshield during the summer). I did this repair myself. It took a while. I shudder to think what the repair shop would have charged for this one.I've also had the headlight wipers fail (I removed them) and the sunroof leaks into the vehicle if I'm parked facing down-slope when it rains.  Luckily, my office has a parking garage so I don't deal with that too often.Also, I cut my finger on the wood veneer peeling off of the dash.  The wood they used was just too thin and the glue fails over time. I'm gradually peeling it off of my dash, it doesn't look good...Normal Maintenance Items:Tires (Tires only last ~50k miles, that's the longest I could get out of a set of Michelins. Thank goodness they're only $500 a set)Brakes (Pads & Rotors once, Pads the 2nd time. This car eats those too).Oil Pan and Valve Cover gaskets. I still have to get the stains out of my garage.Fluids (This thing requires Euro spec synthetic motor oil because of the turbo, it's not cheap - about $80 for the shop to do this oil change).Headlight bulbs only last about 4 months, that's with the long-life version. The 'Silverstar' bulbs only last 4-6 weeks in this car.  These are $20 per pair (for the long-life version).About 'Onstar' - The onstar system they put in my car is completely obsolete. It will not connect to anything now.  I removed the Onstar from my car.2018 Update - New in the 2 years since my last review: Replaced the shifter linkage connection bushing at the transmission.  There's a nylon bushing between the end of the shifter cable and the shift linkage on the transmission.  That apparently fails with age and when it does, you're stuck in whatever gear you were in when it broke.  Fortunately, the part was $5 at Advance or Auto Zone and I was in my driveway when it failed.  If your shifter thinks it needs to be pulled from D to 3 to get the dash display to move from N to D, then it's about to die - you should drive to somewhere flat that you can park and fix this. Fuel Pump & rear gate lifters.Replaced Key Controller Module - When this failed (because water was getting into the sunroof and it collected around this module that sits at the low point of the car below the driver seat), the key no longer did anything EXCEPT unlock the drivers door.  Turning the key in the ignition would turn on accessory power, but nothing else would happen because this module tells the computer if the key is valid, not the key pattern in the lock cylinder.The speakers in the rear doors no longer work so I've got a functional rear subwoofer, but no other sound except for the dashboard speakers.The battery died - that should have been expected.  It was old (first time replacing that in 6 years, which is about average for a good battery).The turbo that I replaced is now smoking heavily again on startup (as long as there's oil above the fill line on the dipstick, which is another question, but I think the turbo is the source of the leak).Also need to replace the Alternator again.I'm not going to do the turbo or the alternator this time. It's time to cut my losses.",2

Even with the 4-cyl it has power to spare and is a kick to drive.  Winter mode is fantastic and it cuts thru the snow like a champ.  For a second drink holder look to the web.  This car turns heads and corners better than my jag at a fraction of the cost and repairs.  Tons of room inside compared to the 3-series or C-class.

Bought it for $4200 and have spent around $3000 on repairs. I absolutely love the car, but the repairs have taken their toll on my wallet. I would say the car has nickel and dimed me, but each repair has cost me $300 to $600 every time. The parts typically have to be shipped in from other states (I'm from Minnesota) since Saab stopped production in 2010. I have been left on multiple occasions without a vehicle for days at a time waiting for the parts to come in. If you're looking for a reliable car that is cheap to fix, please avoid this car. If you have the money and an extra car to drive around while this one spends the time at the autoshop, go ahead and get it. I would love to keep this car, but as I am a college student, I simply cannot afford to keep up with the repair costs. I had the turbo go out on me in March, the PCV Valve needed to be replaced about a week ago. The rear right suspension started leaking hydraulic fluid horribly as soon as I got it after putting it up on a lift to get new tires. The list goes on and on. The heating element in the front driver seat eventually burnt through the seat while I was using it, so I cannot use it anymore unless I want to burn my leg. The front passenger seat's leather ripped open slightly in February, too expensive to fix. Finding replacement windshield wipers for the front and back are impossible to find, as the connectors are vastly different from the normal ones on the market today. The front right headlight flickers a lot due to a faulty connection. The chipped key doesn't always work, so I am not able to lock the car some days, but it typically starts to work about 30 minutes after the ordeal begins. The front instrument panel was burnt out when I got the car, an easy fix, but not worth it at this point.                                                                                                                            Now onto the good things. It drives great, when it isn't getting fixed in the shop. I get excellent gas mileage (about 28) on the highway. Turbo response is great. Very comfortable to drive in. Heated and cooled seats are super nice to have. A/C and heat work really well. Back seats are also heated. Sunroof is a nice addition. Traction control works phenomenally, as does the ABS. It rides pretty nice, but expect to feel every bump and crack in the road. Overall, I'll miss Susie the Saab. If Saab was still in production today, I would probably keep the car, but the expenses are far too great for me to keep the car. Steer clear of this vehicle.",3

The only better seats would be in a Volvo but these provide great support. Living in New England provides a great variety of road conditions that are easily met by this Saab.

Yes, there are a few Saab quirks to get over, but the pleasure of driving it far outweighs any minor nuisances.  Ours is equipped with the Sentronic automatic transmission and performs very well.  In ""Sport"" mode the transmission responds very quickly, especially out of 1st gear and is like IRL's ""push to pass"" button.  The interior is quiet and comfortable.  The wagon has great cargo room and our 2 dogs love it back there.  With a baby on the way, it's a very sensible and responsible purchase, with much better gas mileage than our neighbors' SUVs.

My BMW corners better then the SAAB, but I find the 9-5 much more fun to drive. A comparably equipped 5 series is nearly $60K! Having driven both cars, the BMW is not enough better then then the 9-5 to justify the difference in price. The critics are dead wrong about this car. In my humble opinion I think its still one of of the best looking cars on the road. My SAAB turns far more heads then my BMW ever did. There are definitely a few quirky features on the 9-5, but I think it adds to the whole ""coolness factor"" of the car. If money is not a factor buy the BMW, otherwise save the bucks!",4.75

Excellent road manners with enough stiffness in the ride to remind you that the car is made to handle and perform.

I've never liked a car so much. Until it started leaking oil. Then  the oil gasket blew. And the ABS module blew.   And the serpentine belt blew. And 2 months later the entire belt tensioner blew, causing the serpentine belt to snap, causing a melt down. The list goes on. In the course of a year, I spent $3000  in repairs.  The shameful thing is that I love driving this car so much, I actually considered getting another one.  Had to slap myself out of it, because it really is better as a second car you only take for long highway rides. <Sigh> Guess I'm gonna have to find a 12-step program for Saab drivers. ",4.125

Mainly use it as a winter driver these days, but it is comfortable, quick and very fuel efficient on the highway for the performance the car delivers.  On 6 separate occasions reached over 500 miles (800 kilometres) on a single tank of fuel.    Parts can be expensive, but taking our car to a local ex-Saab mechanic who has his own garage, it's been wonderful.  He immediately is able to diagnosis the situation and supply replacement parts at a price that a regular Saab dealer would not.  Would I purchase a Saab again, absolutely but it has to have the performance, space and efficiency that the 1999-2008 95 has, which I understand is only about a year away.",4.875

A myriad of electronic failures that, come to find out, are outrageously common. Including an ABS module replacement for $3000. The display has been pixelated since around 45000 miles.

The car is zippy, handles very well, and has all the creature comforts anybody would need. Unfortunately I have had to spend a lot of money on this car despite that fact that it is still under warranty. For starters the 3 spoke wheels get bent very easily causing the car to wobble at speeds of over 70mph, the light bulbs need constant replacement, and the battery is very unreliable. If you buy this car make sure you have the warranty otherwise it is going to cost you a lot to keep around. A nice alternative to your run of the mill car.",4

Had some initial electric problems like broken CDchanger but it's being fixed by the dealership. Otherwise this is the best car I ever owned. Drove it already for around 8,000km during last 2 months, mostly highway driving, and Aero performs extremely well on the high- speed. Overtaking is a blast, and acceleration, even with the automatic transmission, puts that nice smile on your face. Sport mode is must on the freeway. Aero drives and handles like a small sports car providing comfort of the luxury sedan. In my opinion exterior styling of the Aero model is a work of art that stands out of the crowd.",5

Respectable highway fuel economy (~25 mpg). Largely reliable (though when needed, repairs/ maintenance is expensive).

I have a set of Winter wheels that I use for my excursions in snow and ice. I have put many SUV drivers to shame in severe snow storms. If only they knew it was about the tires.

This is not my daily driver, that is a 2010 Saab 9-3 sport-combi manual (yes manual) wagon. Both of these have been flawless.  I bought the 9-5 Aero new for $33,000 with an extended warranty that was never used. The only expense was a $65 sensor, which was readily available from GM.I use this car primarily for road trips and do enjoy driving it. I like the aggressive stance, and enjoy the comfort of the car.I figure if I sold it now for even 15k it would still have cost me less than many other cars in terms of depreciation.Not for everyone, but I like that I don't have to turn a knob or click an icon to change a radio station. My wife's Audi is a pain to operate. The Saab is simple to operate, maybe primitive in today's world, but perfectly fine for me.",5
738, on 11/24/15 10:32 AM (PST),vmfan76 ,2011 Saab 9-5 Sedan Turbo4 Premium 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Saab Story," Updated 5/25/2018:Ironically, since the last post which was at 50000 miles (approximately two years ago), I haven't had any repairs done but a couple more things failed. That said, I still loathe driving this car even if it is to reposition it for replacing the summers with winters and again in the Spring. It's my wife's car and she loves it so there's your spectrum.The memory seat is senile and I'm nearly certain this vehicle is trying to kill me. I enter and 50% of the time the key fab is recognized as mine and the seat adjusts, the mirrors adjust, but to a completely arbitrary position. The passenger mirror has an auto-down option for reverse to view the curbs, it continually tries to deflect downward past the limiter and clicks incessantly so I disabled it. The steering still feels like it has sand in it below 45F and now the sunshade fails to close or open or both. Merging onto a 35mph roadway from a ramp during construction with a temporary Yield and a friendly allowance by another motorist reminded me of how alarming an indecisive transmission can be. At 15mph waiting my turn and then being motioned ahead, I accelerated or at least, I moved my foot, nothing. I put my foot down further and total deceleration as the electronics took over and it deliberated over which gear would be appropriate. This is a Lexus 6spd transaxle and I believe the word the dealer used was ""bulletproof."" I don't want my tranny to be ballistically sound, I want it to shift gears. From earlier:Having been a former Saab 9-5 Linear Wagon owner, I though this last ditch effort based on an Opel/Buick La Crosse platform would be relatively safe, particularly at a hefty discount due to the company's dissolved relationship with GM. Absolutely the most buyer's remorse I have experienced in 20 years and 15 vehicles including an Audi, and a Jeep. The seats are strangely difficult to configure to a contour that matches a human's spine, making even a short commute uncomfortable. Each day I'm reminded how even a respected extended warranty program faces challenges when working with a dealership who services Saab. The parts are ridiculously expensive and parts fail routinely. When all is working, a rare and short-lived period of time, the vehicle still gets 24mpg mixed and has terrible road manners in terms of wind noise, the inability to absorb bumps in the road, and performance. The six speed auto is indecisive where a second can lapse, mid-intersection, before it gets the hint you are in a hurry when your foot is buried in the floor board on the accelerator. I'm reminded of Jeremy Clarkson...""I'm a gearbox, I should be doing something...building a cake? Noooo, I know, SHIFT!"" Disappointing to say the least. After 50K miles, I look forward to offloading this vehicle as it has removed all of the joy of driving and ownership. I replaced my Audi with a Subaru and while I knowingly traded fun for function, at least I'm rewarded with relatively low maintenance and repair costs. With the Saab, it is just a chain of repairs with no end in sight and no benefit when the machine is fully functional. The NAV is joke and the infotainment lacks details you would expect from the cheapest of offerings. Stay as far away from it as possible. It hasn't been a Saab for some time but at least my Linear had more influence than picking through GM's used parts' bin.",3

There was no comfortable position to get the lumbar out of my back. I've spent 2 hours total in this car. The fan and instrument controls are tiny, and could be hard to see while driving.Rear view is not good.Trunk opening ala GM, huge lip in back, hard to put in bags.

When shopping for a car this time I wanted something different from those (excellent) German vehicles.The 2011 9-5 is beautifully made and a very tasteful exercise in restraint. Having recently traded in my A8L it is nice to have a break from chrome and wood.

746, on 09/25/15 08:59 AM (PDT),Jessica Gochee ,1999 Saab 9-5 Sedan SE 2.3t Turbo 4dr Sedan,"Love my 9-5, when its running!"," I bought this car in April 2015 with 131k miles. It ran GREAT for about 2k miles then one day I hopped in it while it was parked in my driveway and wouldnt start. I had no previous issues and the breakdown came as a total surprise. Turns out the starter had gone out due to an underlying key ignition issue. I have to physically turn they key back to the ""on"" position immediately after starting. I believe the previous owner did not know the importance of this issue. The starter had probably alot of stress on it due to the key not always being turned back and the starter constantly turning and grinding on other things in the car. After I replaced the starter which I got pretty cheap from eeuroparts.com, it ran good for about another thousand miles. Then while I was on the interstate the car just shut off completely while I was driving with no warning signs and was stuck on the side of the road. Turns out the fuel pump went out at 132k. My dad is a certified mechanic and does all my car repairs and he has consistently been very impressed with the overall mechanical design of the car. Replacing the fuel pump was a breeze because it is located right under the back seat! Nice and easy fix. I have had other issues with a squeaky serpentine belt. But the biggest problem so far has been the oil. I do not suggest running 10W-40 like the car initially recommends. 10 weight is entirely too thick for that car and caused some clogging problems. I kept getting an oil alert warning light and couldnt figure out why because my dip stick read that the oil level was fine. Then the lifters started to tick very loudly. Luckily my dad figured out the issue before it was too late. It ended up being a simple fix with cleaning out the oil pan and drilling some bigger holes in the screen to allow oil to pass through much easier. We plan to switch to synthetic at the next oil change, which is what everyone else recommends too. Still havent fixed the ignition switch but it will be fine if you just turn the key like it is supposed to be. Overall, I couldnt have asked for a better used car! I bought it for $3250 and have put about $800 and most likely will not need to spend much more. It is so fun to drive. Stylish and unique! I get compliments everywhere I go and the turbo is so nice. The manual transmission truly makes me feel like I own a jet. The interior is far ahead of its time in terms  of its technology and design. Despite these problems, I love it and want to keep it forever. I have not minded putting out the money for these repairs because my father and I are convinced that as long as we keep up the maintenance that it will run till the wheels fall off. I would tell anyone to get a saab that has been taken car of.",4

I rolled into the street, blocking traffic and looked like an idiot pushing my car back into my driveway. I ran a stop sign because it stalled and luckily avoided a collision. It cost me tons to fix fuel pump, spark plugs, and carburetor. Weeks after that the timing belt broke on my way to work. On the busiest street possible of course. About $3000 to fix.

Since then, I have also replaced numerous belts, sensors, pumps. Every 3-4 weeks this car was in the shop and needed a new overpriced part that was impossible to find.

Unfortunately, Saab quit employing Aircraft engineers decades ago. I'm an aircraft mechanic and I have no doubt their early models held up best because of their aviation background. I'm convinced their partnership with GM was their ultimate downfall. If you already bought a 9-5, Four words: CHANGE THE OIL OFTEN! Change the ATF or manual GB oil often as well!

Now the ABS has gone, and we stand to spend another thousand, and that is if my mechanic finds a used part.

The other great feature is the huge trunk, it will haul a LOT of stuff! The gas mileage is good too, I've gotten around 35 mpg on the hwy, not bad! For a car in this price class, the ride is noisey on the open hwy. The sheet metal is strong and I feel safe behind the wheel. This is a very underrated car and makes a KILLER deal for a used car.

The only problem has been with the electronic displays, which apparently was a common problem with the 1999. These have since been made more reliable, and the dealer has immediately replaced the ones that have caused trouble. The gas mileage with the manual 5-speed and turbo 4 cyl. has amazed me.

Replaced the turbo bypass valve, vacuum hoses, and fixed brake booster lines(Did all the work myself with the help of a friend so very inexpensive). Other than that nothing beats this car on performance and gas mileage. I get a couple mpg's better than my 9000 Aero. My family is full of Saabs and thats for a reason.

After a very short period, we began to experience a broad range of mechanical issues and failures. This was in spite of the fact that we brought the car back to the dealer for every scheduled maintenance item.  The list of failures is very long and the costs have been very high. The final straw was when, after replacing the timing belt as required, the bearing in the timing belt assembly failed and the engine was destroyed.

I had gotten my feet wet by purchasing a 2006 9-3 Sedan 2.OT, just to get into a SAAB (I had owned less expensive convertibles before that time).  As smitten as I was by the handling and the look of that 9-3 sedan, I missed having a convertible so much, so I decided to trade it in for a convertible two years later.  I purchased a like-new 2008 convertible 9-3 model in 2010, and my goal was to keep it looking as new as when I purchased it.  Well, it's 2017 now, and it really looks the same  as it did that first test drive.  All biases aside, here's my take- it's a fantastic deal for the money, especially now.  This is a car that was designed with safety in mind, and has pop up roll bars, safety alerts, and a number of airbags.  It's also a tremendously fun car to drive.  The four cylinder 2.0 turbo has plenty of power, and the turbo lag is fairly minimal, though I love the sound on a quick acceleration. The car is responsive, quick, and rides fairly quietly for a convertible.  It's also pretty well insulated in the winter, and gets excellent traction with the right tires. I have the cold weather package, which is a must in the colder climates.  As I sit here, I can't think of any unplanned repairs, either.  It's been remarkably reliable (knock on wood).   My only complaint is that I need to apply my high beams in more remote areas at night because the headlights aren't that bright (I had low beams installed, and that helps).  But, other than that, this car feels like it was built for the long haul, and I plan on keeping it for a very, very long time.",5

Why spend 40 grand  (what this listed for when new) to get that wind in your hair feeling, when you can get a used Saab that has some class to it?  Granted it can get expensive, but I do a lot of my own work, brakes, filters, oil, plugs, belts etc. The car itself is solid, tight steering, easy to work on, hugs the road, very quiet for a cloth top, and the 2.0  turbo has plenty of punch. MPG is terrific.  The car is a looker, easy to park, gets plenty of comments and you don't see many of them around. The trunk with the top down can hold enough luggage for a long weekend.  This is just right if you want a nice looking car gets plenty of attention, and if taken care of the 2008 has good reliability reviews.Since my original post in February I received two  recall notices, one for the airbag and another for the seat belt, both of which were repaired by our local dealer. The Saab sat in the garage all winter and was started up every week. I am using synthetic oil, replaced the spark plugs, new battery, put on new brakes, and enjoying the ride. Now the warmer weather is here, it has been driven several times with no issues and look forward to the weekends.  I now have 98,000 miles and it still runs like a champ.  I has a MR2 which was a good car, but had no trunk or room for storage. The Saab is easier to get into, small enough to park in tight areas, yet big enough to carry a few bags of groceries. The back seat isn't roomy, but is big enough for guests on short notice on a spur of the moment trips. We are very happy with this vehicle it, was inexpensive as a used rag top, you don't see many on the road, we get lots of compliments,  great gas mileage, and enough storage for a weekend jaunt for two retired people.The only drawback is you need the OnStar feature for the Bluetooth to work. Since GM no longer services Saab, the buttons are useless. It doesn't affect the performance of the vehicle and isn't a crucial factor for me.Here it is 2018, and  the Saab is still running great. A great car for a weekend jaunt, and love the compliments especially with the top down!",5
842, on 03/09/16 14:38 PM (PST),Al ,2008 Saab 9-3 Convertible 2.0T 2dr Convertible (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Why the hell didn't I consider a Saab before?," I was in the market for a new car and was looking through all of the usual suspects; BMW, Mercedes, Infinity, Cadillac...blah, blah, blah!  I had a very strict amount that I was willing to spend because of kids in college and having to purchase another vehicle for my wife and another for my daughter who gets her license in less than a year.  So, while I was looking I happened to come across a couple of used Saab convertibles.  I did some research and I could not find one really negative review.  That was cool.  I then called a trusted Euro Repair shop in my area.  We discussed the Saab turbo 4 cylinder engine, reliability. maintenance fees, convertible top reliability - a basic rundown of his experience of this car.  His overall input was that it was very reliable, fun and easy to work on car.  He stated that if I took care of it and was REALLY methodical about changing the oil every 2.5K miles, it would last a very long time.So, with that I went to go take a look at the car.  It was Silver with Black interior and it was in phenomenal shape.  82K miles.  Very good maintenance records and it had been taken care of.  Car Fax showed everything was clean. Away we went for the test drive!I immediately noticed that the instrument cluster is laid out very logically and easy to read.  I absolutely love the ignition being in the center console.  It's different!  I fire it up, drop it in drive and head out on the test.  Tight steering, front wheel drive 'pull' feels different than rear wheel drive 'push', but it bites and performs really well.  Quite, low road noise and surprising performance are things that hit me right away.  Seats are very firm but comfortable.  I approach the freeway and push the pedal down.  Wow!  Nice!  Great acceleration, handling and we quickly reach 85mph in no time and all of this while not even being in 'Sport' mode. I've driven and owned pretty much every import and I am embarrassed to say that I never looked at a Saab before.  The fact that the company is no longer around makes me wonder if they would have been a little more Marketing savvy, if they would still be around.  Who knows!!??  What I do know is that I love this car. Convertible top works flawlessly, it looks great, it performs incredibly well.   Gas mileage is exceptional given the performance.  Bang for the buck, I could not have made a better choice.  I'm looking forward to many road trips in this awesome ride!  Great fun!",5

I leased it with an automatic (my only regret so far) in Fusion Blue.  Dealer worked hard to make the deal.  On Star is a great feature and already worked to unlock my car when I left the keys in side. If you want a unique car with lots of personality, I recommend it.

My only complaint is the electronics are an expensive mess. Even though repaired, the electronic locks never seem to work correctly. Even after being repaired it didn't take long before the locks were a problem again. Frequent and costly repairs have caused me to rethink my ownership of this vehicle.  You expect repairs on an older vehicle but the repairs needed are constant and costly.  I recently had my vehicle towed into the dealership and they said it was the battery and replaced it.

A friend of mine had a 2005 Saab 9-3 and the first time I rode in it I was truly surprised. It was far from the hatchback design of the S900 and it was quick and had nice fit and finish.This began my passion for these cars. I have driven a 2005 9-3 2.0T a 2006 9-3 aero, and two different 2008 9-3 2.0T. All the cars I had were great although I did experience less than stellar performance in the Pirelli and Continental tires that they were putting on the cars until 2008 when the TMPS sensor option was included. I have been very pleased with the reliability of all the cars I owned and feel that the 2008 and up Model Years to have the best long term reliability. This is why I went ahead and purchased one after my lease on my first 08 9-3 ended. The overall fuel efficiency of this car is excellent and seems to beat many other makes for the power output that it gives. I worked for VW and Audi and have driven many of their cars and just dont feel that their 2.0T has as much power as the 9-3. Even though the 2.0Tfor Audi and VW has been rated very high I know internally that there are still issues with oil consumption and slug in models that this engine has been used in, and thats why I would never purchase anything containing their 2.0T. The new styling in 08 really for me was a winner. I had appreciated the older design, but wasnt a fan of all the plastic rubbing strips and trim that was visible on the outside of the car. I was happy to see that the facelift was focused on the outside and left the interior relatively untouched. The only thing that I wish had been standard on the 2.0T is visible sports exhaust, and xenon option. I really enjoy the interior and the only thing I would have like to see is a little less plastic and more leather covered surfaces like on the door handles and the front panel that surrounds the radio and instrument cluster. The leather Ive noticed stays in good condition if you maintain it, however if you dont after about 100,000K the drivers seat gets pretty rough looking. In older VW models that have leather it holds up much better probably due to several seemed portions on the seat bottoms rather than one large piece that tends to get stretched like in the 9-3.

Comfortable, even with two car seats in the back. Fully loaded for vacation there is plenty of room. The car gets ~24 mpg in the city (worse when my wife drives it) and ~34 mpg on the highway at a comfortable 65-70 mph.  Leather interior is easy to clean when the kids spill food/drinks. So far reliability has been impeccable...knock on wood because servicing will be pricey on this car. Useful speed warning feature as you can pass 70+mph easily.

The 2008 has zero remaining interior parts from its original designs, aside from the headlight and windshield washer logos printed on the corresponding controls. The 2008 thus far has had zero issues or electrical problems that were found in previous models. The quirkiness is thankfully still part of SAAB's design; its ignition, is located in the middle console, similar to the original floor concept.

It tracks very well in the snow and ice. It rides hard, even over medium quality metro freeways. So much so that on one bump I was tossed upward in the car and hit my head on the ceiling. I have been known to grunt in anticipation of road bumps. Maybe this is because of my bad back and age 43. I had an '87 Saab 900S several years ago in my youth and loved it. My new Saab is fast and fun to drive on smooth roads, but I may have bitten off more than I can chew. A loaded Accord would have been a better choice for me.

While BMWs handle more neutrally, the Saab makes more power for much less than a comparable BMW (328/335 xi).  I would have to purchase a near fully loaded 335xi to get this much comfort, convenience, and performance at a cost of nearly $13k more. If you pay anywhere near sticker for these cars you are paying way too much. Wait for a GM year end sale.  BMWs are priced nearer selling price. Still, I prefer the Saab regardless. BMW's I-drive, run flat tires, and depreciation (net loss) were the final straw with me. I want a car that is fun to drive up to 9/10th, and this Saab delivers.

After many test drives, there is nothing with more punch/dollar. Performance is impressive for 4cyl turbo. Peak torque and hp at low rpms means accessible speed. You're flying before you know it. Some turbo lag, but prep to ~2500 rpm and it's a rocket. Too much body roll on corners, but grip on the road seems unaffected. Mine is AT, but the MT is a joy. You've got to drive it even if not buying. Love the brakes...lots of expression.  As always with Saab, the controls become intuitive. Radio and climate aren't impressive.

However, I'm not into the white & chrome tail lights that came in 2008. It drives very well, power comes on quickly, quietly and before you know it your over the speed limit. But the seats are too wide and I slide around in corners. Most dissapointing it that it seems to be more GM than a Saab. Flimsy cup holders and console lid.

The new C300 and C350 handled great but I was really unimpressed with how awful the seats and interior materials were for a Benz. The Aero XWD was a blast. Excellent seats, 280 hp turbo engine.

Although the Saab 9-3 might not rate best in class for any one category it does well in a lot of them.  I have had mine for about a month and am delighted with it in every detail.  It is a dream on the highway cruising at just over 2,000 rpm in 6th gear, rolling beautifully and extremely quiet.  I had a Saturn Aura prior to the Saab and find it worlds more enjoyable.

The only reason I bought another Saab is because I was deployed with the army for all of 2008 and returned to my hometown (Detroit area) to a completely depressed economy.  Bought this car at 12,000 miles in MINT condition for $16,000 out the door.  A year later at 25,000 miles, it has not let me down.  100K / 6 years from inception bumper-to-bumper.  Failures thus far have been minor.  No warranty claims yet, but will drop off soon for a center console arm rest that slides too freely.  My #1 gripe is the sub-par sound system and iPod input jack.

I was very impressed with the performance and handling.  The interior worked well for me and the power delivered by the 250 hp engine was exhilarating!  The windshield washer reservoir had to be replaced twice - then they came out with the recall.  The back brakes created a tremendous amount of dust compared to the front. ???? Finally replaced the pads with EBC reds - problem solved.  The Saab emblems peeled off after just three years but the dealer replaced them free.  The turbo blew a gasket at 75000 miles and the dealer originally quoted it at $3700 but when I declined they talked to Saab and could get it done for $900.  ????,4.375

The car looks very nice, it's lots of fun to drive.  It is faster than most of the similar priced European makes (which are usually more expensive).  The 2-tone leather interior with silver trims look sporty and modern.  The 2.8 V6T does consumes significant amount of fuel, which can add up, specially if you follow the owner's manual requirement of premium fuel only.  Overall, I love it!  ",4.875

We chose the Aero with the Six-Speed manual tranny after testing out the 2.0 automatic, which was great, but a little twitchy in response for me.  The Aero definitely has a better low-end and the manual tranny means I get to control it exactly as I want.   This is by far one of the most enjoyable cars to drive. The Turbo is better than most other cars I've driven. It always turns heads and gets a lot of compliments.  It's nice not seeing so many on the road as well. Just had Coolant reservoir replaced via recall.  Saab service has always been strong and quick to fix any issues...of which I've had very few (replaced stereo amp).",4.625

We have some snow in Utah (SLC), and I think it handles as well if not better than my old Subaru Outback with all-season Michelins, guess you have to know how to drive in the snow.

I wanted something upscale but not the same thing everyone else had (G35, 3- series, A4, etc).  I found myself leaning toward the Swedes so it was down to the 9-3 or the Volvo S40.  I drove the S40 and the turbo lag was scary so I drove the 9-3 and was sold.  The only problems I've had were the coolant reservoir needing to be replaced (under warranty) and my ignition switch failed after a few drops of coffee spilled in it.

So in my two years of owning the car I've spent about $800 in repairs. I am extremely thankful for this but I do take very very good care of my Saab. I bought this car out of college after doing a good amount of research. I wanted a nice, sporty car that that offered a little luxury but didn't cost a fortune to buy or repair.

I've easily spent close to 1,500 on this car so far (including the pricy 60K maintenance).  So far the horn and both power windows have broken, along with the temp. gauge.  The front of the car/wheel well is currently squeaking.   Regardless of these issues this car IS A BLAST TO DRIVE!

Only have 26,000 miles but expect to have 36,000 by next May when the car turns three.  So far, it has been trouble free except for the decal coming off the hood once which was fixed under warranty.  Otherwise, this car gets great gas mileage (29-36 on highway, 18-24 in city - beating EPA estimates of 19 and 29), is completely reliable, and has the acceleration of a new V6 Honda Accord with about 10 mpg better.

The Saab's seats are very comfortable and there are a lot more features in the Saab.  Acceleration is great and overall very fun to drive.  The vehicle does have unique look to it without being quirky or gimmicky. Hwy mileage has been excellent at 29- 31. City is good at 24 mpg.  Mileage can be worse if you really step into it. I was concerned about overall reliability so I did purchase the service contract with it. Huge amount of features and adjustments for the sound system, climate control, and information systems.

It's a very nice car for the buck, but I wouldn't buy one.  That's just my personal preference but my sixth sense told me that this car would cost a lot of cash to maintain for the long haul.  Drives great, handles great.  The turbo 2.0L engine is sluggish with the A/C on full blast, but otherwise very quick and great on the highway when you need some extra power.  The exterior is very high quality, interior is the same way.  Not sure why Saab put a completely useless 3""x2.5"" screen on the dash.  It has an integrated phone, but it only works in Sweden, not in the US, so all those buttons are useless unless you live in Sweden. ",4.125

With a daily commute of 90 miles round trip, I wanted a car that that drove and handled well without the need for a stiff suspension and low profile tires.  It also had to have good gas mileage, decent acceleration and run on regular gas. This car does it all. One of the most comfortable cars to drive that I have ever owned. The engineers at Saab have geared this car perfectly.  At typical commuting speed, the engine pulls about 2300 RPM.  This is the cars sweet zone. At this speed, the engine is responsive, road feel is fantastic, steady and there are no vibrations or annoying harmonics. No service issues and I am getting 29.5 mpg (hwy).  ",4.75

In the past year, we've had to trek to the dealership monthly, weekly, even daily with issues like: radio, emblem falling off, multiple fog light replacements, tires, brake pads, repeated coolant issues, and today the engine started smoking (while driving home from the Saab service dept. after they 'fixed' the engine yet again!)

The saab service agents don't care and fail to inspect my entire car when I bring it in, so I have to keep going back.  Speakers are fuzzy.  Just replaced another battery and a corroded switch.

We take it to the Saab dealership service department and two weeks later it is back in the shop for the exact same problem.  The front leather seats are very uncomfortable.

Front spoiler is so low you can't turn into a graded driveway without it scraping. I broke mine going through snow. So far the sunroof, Stability Control (ESC)have required repair.

The turbo charged 4 cylinder offers plenty of power, especially at higher RPMs. Even enthusiasts will enjoy the base 2.0T engine.  For max performance and control, I suggest using the manual shift feature with the automatic transmission. I have really pushed this motor to the max and it is equal to the task.

This car is worth a serious look.  There have been no major problems so far at 15,000 miles.  Minor problems include: a 6 disc cd changer that jammed and had to be replaced, many of the parchment interior body panels were slightly discolored on delivery, and there are a few rattles predominantly in the door panels (a bit disappointing for a $30,000 car).

I never had an European car but when I test drove it is immediately bought. For a little turbo engine, it had lots of power and great acceleration.  Drove it for a year without problems.   At 84k it started to rattle near the undercarriage on uneven roads.  I replaced the lower control arms and bushings but to no avail it still made noise. Fixed the noise temporarily with wd40 and spraying the bushings. The next issue I ran into was the keyless entry would work 1 out 30 times. The worst part of this was the reconnection I had to do everytime I got into the car. And the loud alarm noise when opening it with the cut key. The only fix was to buy a newer serial fob. $80 plus $50 electronic installment fee. next problem was the coolant reservoir tank. It was an easy DIY. The last issue that caused me to sell the car was the small leak in the AC. It wasn't too bad but every spring I had to refill the AC. A bit annoying but it's cheaper than replacing the whole unit. Also there was a clicking noise when I turn on the coldest setting.  Overall, fun car to drive with multiple small problems. P.S. Cup holders are neat but terrible.

I had to replace lower left ball joint, both struts (and mounts), springs, the entire car computer, rain sensor, radio, seatbelt, & ignition. Don't get me wrong the car was a great car but I am a college student and it was difficult to pay for repairs. I suggest not buying one unless you plan to have repair bills & you KNOW you CAN pay them. Saab's going out of business & the company is only required to make parts 10 years after the car was made. Plan on not finding any parts by '13.",3.875

Could not start after transmission programming fixed ( 800 miles away from home) 7) Service engine soon came on and was a false read.  If you don't mind going to the dealership every month, then this car is for you!  Won't buy another one.  Will buy German from now on. ",3.375

This car is worth infinitely more than its list value. What else -- oh, even though this black beauty doesn't look to me to be much different at all style-wise from a few other (black) sedans (e.g. Mercedes-Benz), it still gets compliments so I'm thinking it must have some slight styling edge over other similar-looking cars.

When comparably equipped, the Saab was cheaper. The Saab rode better and there wasn't a gazillion on the road.  31-34 MPG during mostly highway driving.  GM should quit playing sticker games.

The new 6-speed is the best manual trans. Saab has ever had, and the driving dynamics are superior to my old 900 in every way.  The car is buttoned down and feels smaller that it is.  I also really like the interior, which they've now made lighter and brighter.

Even the weatherstripping is still in great shape. Being a chop-top convertible, it was a bit shaky on bumpy roads and you could feel some body flex when cornering. I've added a subframe brace and swapped in a bigger rear anti-roll bar, and it now feels very solid. I can't believe how well this thing handles now as a FWD car, especially with the OE Goodyear all-seasons on it. Whenever I think I might be pushing it a little too hard it just hangs right on without so much as a howl. Why spend $5-6k more on the equivalent BMW when you can do just as well with under $400 worth of easy-to-install modifications?",5

It's worth about $1500 to a private party, but it's way more more car than that!  The truth, as I see it is this: If you have a mechanic who knows Saabs, owns the right equipment, and understands how to fix them, you are good-to-go.  We are lucky to have Ray and Rich at Auto Works of Knoxville in our area.  Ray bought all the right equipment to service Saabs years ago, and customers come from as far as St. Louis, MO to have their Saabs worked on here.  Ray and Rich know these cars and keep us up and running.Saabs are Saabs...quirky and sometimes frustrating to own.  Ours, we call her ""Sadie"", will suddenly decided she's going to turn on the check engine light and stay in second gear.  The fix is a reset with a code reader.  Works great for six months, then she does it again.  Then about every two years, she'll just stop running at a stop sign.  Suddenly starts idling rough and shuts down.  Solution?  Rich cleans the throttle body and resets the computer.  ""The next time, though, the throttle body will need replacement"" says he.  Ray says we can still keep driving her, he can still get parts, and anticipates he will be able to for years to come.  Stellar performance, especially from a car valued at $1500....Oh yeah, we spent $600 last year to fix a tiny, flimsy switch that lets the top go down successfully.  You have to be able to cuss in Swedish to get your fingers in the place this thing goes, and the flimsy switch is replaced by another...flimsy switch.  But hey, it still works and is fun.

I stayed on top of maintance and the car never let me down. At 230,000 miles I drove the car cross country coast to coast all the time without any fear of breakdowns. I even cruised at triple digits out in the desert with no problems. Engine still strong at that mileage. Frequent oil changes highly recommended to prevent sludge in these engines and to prevent turbo failure. Car still has original transmission at 230,000 miles. The car feels very light and corners like a sports car. These Saabs do have electrical problems but the only ones I encountered were passengers door lock stopped working and the high beam shutter in the Xenon headlights stopped working so no more high beams. I would definitely recommend getting the daytime running lights disabled at a shop that specializes in Saabs because they come from the factory with the daytime running lights which leave the headlights on all the time whenever the car is on. If your car is equipped with Bi Xenon headlights like mine was you don't want them on whenever the car is on because the bulbs are expensive and if the high beam shutter stops working like it did in mine then you're looking at $750 a headlight for replacement. Also check the Coil Springs on all four corners because they tend to rust due to poor coating from the factory which can lead them to breaking which is not good if it happens while driving. The car gave me an impressive 39mpg on the highway during summer days and 34mpg during winter on the highway. The car gave me 24 mpg in the city. The car has more than enough power for everyday day driving. The car is amazing in the snow and it's a great cold weather car. Never got stuck in snow and drove it in multiple snowstorms where there was so much snow that only rigs and trucks were on the roads. The car also survived every day cold starts in -20 degree weather never failing to start. I will definitely be buying another Saab in the future. Great European cars. Stay on top of maintance and you will get a car that is reliable, sporty, good looking, good on gas, great driver in any weather, turbo power, handles, great cargo space, room for 5 people, luxury features for the year of the car! There's a reason why there's so many of these on the roads especially in the northeast!!",5

You have to notice the sloped hood and clean exterior styling, a testament to Saabs new-age design. The interior is pretty roomy, but the paint can scratch off and some parts feel like cheap plastic was used. The CD changer works well as does the radio.   This car drives excellently, and using the sport shifter allows you to get some pretty solid acceleration times, with the turbochargers help though! Highway performance is EXCELLENT, and the car handles exceptionally especially when the ESP control is on. We even took it up to the mountains and it handles excellently even with front wheel drive.",4.375

And everyone loves how it looks.  The biggest negative is the cost of repair.  I haven't had many (knock on wood) but those that I've had are expensive.  Then again, it's less expensive to than an Audi or BMW.  Second big complain is that the wheels are held on my bolts, not lugs.  All five need to be at proper torque for the wheel to balance.  Also, the wheel hub and bolt are softer metal, so I've already had to re-tap one wheel twice due to electric wrench happy mechanics.",4.5

GM made plastic buttons have peeled. Original Saab parts lasted forever. Love/hate relationship with a brand that harkens back to speed and safety.,3

While Saab has had it's many challenges over the years it has always produce a solid performer with above average reliability. Unfortunately the markets tends to go with the brands with the biggest budget to impress you with the image of it's brand. Saab has done a outstanding job mixing form with function. Everyone who has enjoyed the ride in my car are always impressed with the quality and find themselves asking why they never considered on. Saabs brand deserves leadership that can carry it's unique niche and continue it's quality builds to attract more owners looking for something that just works well.,4.375

If you look at any one detail of the car it may or may not be best in class, but when combined it just makes you smile. It gives a solid, tight, controlled ride, a little busy on bad pavement. You're very connected to the road. Acceleration from a dead stop is nothing special, but when you're on the road the passing power is impressive! Very comfortable seats. The automatic top opens/closes in 20 secs, even if you're driving (slowly). The stereo isn't strong, but its notes & sounds are very precise (don't confuse bass boost with good music). There's a reason this is Saab's most popular car. ",4.75

If you don't know anything about them you shouldn't buy one.! I'll give you an example.  When I first bought this car I went to do an oil change and realized for the first time in my life that I owned a car that was too low profile to put up on ramps. I called every auto parts store in the area and no one had any kind of ideas so I went to YouTube and found a solution by using two long boards.  When I bought the car the entire audio system was not functioning. The dealership told me that the amp underneath the driver seat was damaged due to corrosion a common problem. Replacing was $1400 or rebuild $600. Again I went to YouTube and found that I could remove the entire amp and fuse the fiber optics together and solve the problem no cost just an hour's worth of work. Now I have a permanently fixed working radio and audio system. But those are not things that most people would want to do or could do. If you are good at doing things yourself this is a great car for you, if you're not you're going to get taken to the cleaners by people that overcharge and take you for a ride literally. It's good to do your research first to know what you're getting into and find some mechanics you can rely on and rely on yourself for most of the repairs that are small!Few other things. It needs synthetic oil  every 10,000 miles. Fresh battery every few years even a little bit off will make it run funny. Needs all fluids and filters checked frequently to make sure they are all clean and in good shape. If you do this the car will last pretty much forever! My old Saab has 209000 miles and I'm still driving it everyday. I bought the 93 and it's like a new car inside and out! Some people say the interior is cheap by comparison to other Saabs but I disagree.  Although some plastic parts may appear a little bit cheaper they can be well maintained and look great.  The seats and interior are great...very comfortable.... excellent gas mileage too. Most of these cars will have to have the  suspension worked on by a hundred thousand miles. When I purchased it I put on some new sway bar links which typically wear out fast. They cost $18 apiece. I  also put on a new flex pipe on the exhaust.  Total of about $100.Also had to clean the throttle body due to a rough idle issue because it was dirty and never before cleaned. Replaced the spark plugs and the air cleaner as well. All should be good now for the next hundred thousand miles except for oil changes. If you purchase one do yourself a favor and buy an OBD2 code reader so if a light pops on you can easily identify the problem rather than being ripped off by a dealership! The car is reliable and rides great. Its fast and looks great. It's 11 years old and could not have run better when new.Update: Still feel the same a year later. Unfortunately this is now my only Saab since my older 900 was ruined by a Tuffy oil change place that overfilled it by almost 2 quarts and killed the engine. I will never trust them again.",5
1491, on 09/15/15 15:23 PM (PDT),Renee Lindsay ,2005 Saab 9-3 Sedan Linear 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 5M),Best Small Car!," Just bought my 2005 Linear 93 2.0t a month ago and it's the funnest car I've ever owned. The ride, the pick up on the highway is awesome. I have a automatic with the optional manual and it will definitely get you down the road in a hurry. I get 28 mpg so far. I paid 4k and it's the best money I've ever spent on a car.",5
1492, on 07/16/15 15:17 PM (PDT),Greg Maldonado ,2005 Saab 9-3 Sedan Linear 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 5M),"Love it or hate it, average car at average price."," This isn't your typical 1990's and older Saab. You won't get the blazing midrange speed nor the amazing cabin view of the outside world, but you will get a decent family sedan that gets decent MPG and has top-of-the-line safety features.In base form the 2.0 Linear Sports Sedan is a slow, safe family car with a little bit of Saab watered down into the GM-inspired plastic interior and bodywork. For the Saab purist, stay away from this car; you will despise it and all the GM parts that went into making it. If you can overlook that stained heritage and settle into the comfortable leather/vinyl seats, adjust the electric mirrors for best view, and get the steering wheel tilted and positioned to your liking, you'll find this car is quite tolerable and easy to drive. You just won't drive it very quick. The small turbo has enough boost to keep up with all but the fastest traffic, but it lacks the serious boost power to be entertaining. The handling is predictable and pleasant. This is a sedan you can toss into a corner and not really worry about, thanks to the generous traction control and the FWD handling. In wild weather that same traction control system helps keep you firmly planted on the road, and with a good set of winter tires you can go places that seem impossible.I bought mine in Beige Metallic, used  as a program car, with 120,000 miles on the odometer and have owned it almost exactly one year. In that year the most expensive repair has been replacing the pitted windshield, and the battery. I have repaired/replaced many items that were worn from age, including bumper inserts, windshield glass and rear glass surround, trim pieces, hoses, lamps, door seals, and misc fasteners. I have added a better sound system and upgraded the engine management computer as well as the turbo, but have not altered the body or interior. It now drives with a more sporty feel while still maintaining the overall factory look. I drive 98% city with very little open highway. My city MPG hovers around 21mpg while the best estimate I have for Highway is 38mpg.That said, this car doesn't respond well to modifications. The Trionic8 computer system which controls the car prevents most quick-and-dirty bolt-on items from adding any significant improvement. The T8 system in the Linear is intended for daily-driver and economy, and does what it can to keep performance at that level. That T8 system can be upgraded (similar to ""chipping"" on other cars), and a few other items can be upgraded to help increase performance up to around the base Aero specs with minimal effort and expense, thus providing the Linear with a little bit more sportiness. Of course, as with any car, if you throw large amounts of money at it you can get it to perform to your budget, if you want.As everything is run on a BUS computer system, and Saab having now gone out of business, locating a technician to work on the car can be a slight hassle. While the same TECHII diagnostics system for the same years of GM models can be used on these models of Saab, not many GM dealerships have the knowledge to repair Saab cars.Oh, yes. The ignition is on the center console, there is a pop-n-swing-out cupholder on the dash, and the dashboard has a Night Mode which turns off all the interior illumination and gauges except for the most basic speedometer and management controls. This car has one of the highest safety and crash ratings for the model year.Pros: Safe. Reliable. Great handling. Good view from the cabin with no blind spots. Good fuel economy. Inexpensive to repair (comparable to same years of GM vehicles for most repairs - lots of parts interchange to other makes and models). Good air conditioning system. Easy to maintain and repair if you are self-motivated.Build quality is average. There is a lot of plastic and cheapness in the interior. Externally everything fits together well and feels solid. Sound system is good but not outstanding, lacking fidelity and power.Cons: No performance from the economy engine and computer. Computer BUS system requires diagnostics equipment to diagnose car troubles. Lack of repair technician support. Difficult to upgrade performance using normal methods. Sound system upgrade is near impossible due to the use of fiber-optic system. Heating system could be better due to a very odd mix-control system which leaves cold spots by design. Climate control motors are prone to breaking gears.Overall the Saab-ness of this car barely shines through the GM whitewashing, with excellent safety but sleep-inducing sportiness. It is an overall average family sedan with some interesting little twists to the common interior controls.Addendum. 4 years on and this little rough-cut zirconia or a car is still running well. No major issues, with only standard wear parts like brakes and tires needing to be replaced.",5

It handles beautifully and the turbo is just something else on it. It's really fun to drive. Quality is one of the best in my eyes. As long as u take care of it, it will last. It's very well built in my opinion. However, don't take it to Saab dealers when it needs a repair or maintenance, they really charge a lot. B/c they expect u to be rich to own a Saab. Rather, find a private mechanic that is good with Saabs. By the way I get at least 36mpg on the highway, and 25 in the city when I drive fast and 28 when I drive economically.

I easily put 50,000 miles on in one year and never had anything major go wrong. Tires, synthetic oil, blah blah blah. The point? No problems. I had been warned by many about a Saab's reliability. This obviously proved untrue. The zero to whatever as many reviews have testified to is nothing to write home about. It's better than most I would say, but passing power with the auto-stick transmission is a blast. The trunk is huge, backseats are small and the overall comfort for the driver is sufficient. Good tires go a long way and I tinted all of the side and rear windows which dramatically improves overall car appearance (I think).",4.75

The interior quality and the handling were better than the Passat or the Volvo v40, and on par with the Audi A4, but 5k cheaper than the Audi. And after cash back, only about 2k more than a VW. The interior and the trunk are larger than any of those competitors, which is great, given the baby seat we recently had to install. The 9-3 offers 99 percent of the quality of a BMW 3 series or Audi A4, but for a lot less money. This car is a steal.  ",5

Stay away from these car's GM ruined them. If you want a Saab look for a pre 1991 model that's when they were reliable. On a positive my Viggen got AMAZING fuel economy for a turbo car.

It fell victim to the ""Saab oil sludge problem"" that so many other 9-3's and 9-5's from this era have succumbed to (Google ""Saab oil sludge"" and read all about it).  Long story short, Saab admitted the oil sludge accumulation is due to an engine defect, NOT consumer negligence, and they ""extended coverage"" on '99-'03 9-3's and 9-5's. What they don't tell you is that you're not eligible for coverage unless you can produce oil change receipts for the entire  life of the car. So for those, like myself, who bought their car used, you're essentially fresh out of luck. It's either pony up $6000 for a new engine or scrap it for parts.",1.625

It's an unusual and unique car, very stylish, performs well, and is extremely practical. It has a ton of safety features that rival modern cars, high performance and handling that holds its own even today, and efficiency that approaches the prius (of the same year). The seats are very comfortable; I have no trouble at all driving for 9+ hours straight, travelling between OR and CA. It's been a very reliable car. A few valves have gone bad, some lines have split, the fuel pump went bad, and a relay needed to be replaced, but it's still running strong. SAAB's B204 engine is a total powerhouse, it has a nice reliable timing chain, and famously over-engineered internals (they can supposedly handle upwards of 500Hp on stock internals). I have mine running a tune, bringing it up to 225Hp and 245lb-ft of torque, and the engine is at 230,000 miles. It's a very quick car, with a light tune puts down far more power than lots of modern sportscars, tons of cargo space,  and is very comfortable and composed to drive, with a highly driver-oriented interior.

While out of warranty, I thought a call to SAAB USA was needed. No cars head gasket and turbo should go out at 60,000 mi... they have been dragging their feet and wanting every detail as to oil changes and the like. There is no doubt, they are balking.

We have used it three times in the 2+ years of owning the car. It is well worth it knowing that the parts come from Sweden and they do not manufacture saabs anymore. I would not like the car as much if i didn't have the warrantee. When people review cars, they need to realize that what they are buying is the same car they test-drove.

I have almost replaced everything on it but the engine turbo and radiator: clutch and clutch cable, radiator fan, fuel pump (twice in 6 months), starter, alternator and water pump, cdriver's side door lock actuator, radiator hoses, direct ignition cassette, brake pads and rotors (all 4), one engine mount, sepertine belt, thermostat, flex pipe and muffler.  Leather is trashed, poor quality. Heated seats don't work anymore. Cd changer broke, 4 speakers blew out so I replaced the system. There is a reason these cars depreciate 60-70% in 3 years.  Spend the extra money and buy a beemer (which performs far better).",3.375

Also the top didn't work tonneau motor problems. that was pricey to fix. overall I'm very happy with it. Excellent fuel economy and i love the leather and look of it with the top down. good acceleration for just a 4 banger. runs smooth above a hundred. My first car @ 18 years old.

(previous owner had a lot of work done and a new top installed just before I bought it!) Its a lot of fun to drive and it corners decently well. The center of gravity is a little high so it tends to roll in corners. But otherwise driving it is a blast.

At 126K miles, I expected another 20 or 30 K before facing high repair costs. Since I've purchased the Saab in 2006 & having no idea of the kind of conditions the previous owner placed on the vehicle, I've since invested at least 1/3 the original cost into more than just simple wear and tear.

It's not the cheapest to maintain but it's very reliable. My personal opinion is that as far as maintanance I have spent a bit over 4000 dollar these last 2 years including the standard 95,000 service wich costs 550 dollars. Replacement of the top motor with labor $770 (was replaced 3 years ago) and certain other repairs which can be traced back to foul weather (snow, salt).

While I really enjoyed *having* this car, I don't think I would make this decision again.  I had a Honda before and I like the cheap maintenance and regular unleaded fuel.

First let me say, do not worry about what KBB, NADA, Black Book, and Edmund’s say about price. These are fetching $2-5k over book value due to rarity and style. For my location it stated $5500-7500, of course since my state gets tons of snow for 6-8 months out of the year, 4x4 / AWD vehicles carry an extra premium beyond that, and these sites / books never take location and needs / demands into account– The initial asking price was $12000, got it for $7500. As stated my state (Alaska) has a huge premium on 4x4 / AWD, especially as winter approaches.  Currently on EBay these vehicles are listed around $6500 to $12000. Mine only had 84400 when purchased this summer, which is low for a 10 year old vehicle. -The other reason for purchasing - my last car was a 2014 Cruze with 23k miles. It was horrible!!! Worst clutch ever, and had no power, and took a $1500 hit because the front seat was killing my lower back, my wife and kids hated it, and was tired of being kicked on trips, plus my wife is unable to drive a manual due to spinal fusion.  Hate to step into an older vehicle with more miles, but it has been well worth it, and stepping up from a car with a mere 138hp and 128tq into something over double the power was also well worth it. My Cruze weighed over 3200 pounds with 138hp and poorly a placed torque curve-The 9-7X’s power feels tremendous since 90% torque is available at 1700rpm and continues this path through majority of its power band. Having owned a few sub 7 and 6 second cars over the years, this one feels a bit quicker than the 7.6 quoted in Car&Driver. Reason for this? If you read their articles, most long term testers lose anywhere from 3-7/10th after 40-60k miles. Engine tolerance has been so tight this last 20 years, many vehicles actually feel stronger after a couple years of ownership. However, this is ‘butt’ of the seat feel from experience. My guess would 7.2 seconds to 60 with a good launch. Only did this once for test drive.  Either way, it has plenty of power for most people and will easily walk people from a light if you’re not careful. Most often I only need 1700-1900rpm to maintain a slight lead at stop lights. The 4.2i pulls nicely with a unique, but similar straight-6 sound. -Okay, parts are hard to find, and would purchase an extra set of vents and safely store them because eventually the originals will break while detailing. Same with the radio and climate control, these have paint wear, and there are few options to restore these. -Some articles say this vehicle is not worth it, but if they’re actually to drive a regular Trailblazer, Envoy, etc, it is a night and day difference. The 9-7X has airbags in the rear for starters, and the general suspension geometry was completely re-calibrated with components. Having driven my uncles Trailblazer with new struts, my 9-7X with original parts easily out shines it with handling. The SAAB feels like a different vehicle all together since the interior fit and finish is superior, plus the handling is just so much better.-Basically, do not read those articles. Trust me, go drive a Trailblazer and then drive a 9-7X. The best part is Trailblazer are everywhere and this should not be a problem. Also, Trailblazer are typically priced similarly to a 9-7X and the SAAB has far more features.-Gas mileage is great considering weight and power. I average 18 in mixed driving, but one trip was 23 mpg for over 200 miles. Besides, my wife has a 2016 Escape and she gets 28 combined with 33-34 on the highway – so this is not our long distance hauler. Basically this is a very personal feeling vehicle. Hopefully this review conveys that.-----Updated mileage from 85500 to 89500-----my feelings have not changed since writing this review-----AWD system is not the best compared to my wife's Escape or my old Subaru. However it does well enough and since this vehicle is nice, I may install a transfer case from an Envoy with the Envoy's locking rear end. The AWD is one that engages when slip is detected. This can be abrupt and brutal at time depending on how much throttle is used, or if your rear is on a slippery surface, but your front tires are not.",5

There were only two options (Nav and DVD entertainment) for the 5.3i which i got and just love.

In the years we've owned it, the transmission went out (in less than two years), the fuel sensor broke (which we fixed under the recall), the oil pressure sensor broke (we fixed on our own), the led brake light in the back went out and we had to replace it for $150, the cup holder that pops out near the radio broke...plus it was the worst cup holder that was every designed because you can only hold a small can of soda or a small fountain drink in there, other wise the drink constantly spills over on the floor, the check tire pressure comes on every now and then when the tires are perfectly fine, the service tire monitor comes on a few times a month and that's annoying, especially when there's nothing wrong with it, and sometimes the traction control will take affect in the middle of summer.  Also with the power seats, sometimes the seat fails to move back or forward....we finally figured out that if you hit the front of the seat hard, it will start working again.  Then back to the cup holders, there are two in the front and two in the back.  I already talked about the one, but the other in the front is in a horrible spot.  You can only put a small soda can there and that's it.  As soon as you put the vehicle in park, the gear shifter covers the spot of the cup holder.  So a larger drink, you have to take out of the cup holder in order to put the car into park.  The cup holders in the back were also poorly designed (they are near the floor in the middle).  Any type of vibration or turn makes the drinks fall over from the holders and spill all over the floor.   Don't even get me started on fuel economy.  They also designed it that the jack is located underneath the middle seats....which if you have a car seat back there, you have to take the car seat out first then fold it up to get to it.  should have built it in the back cargo area.  The only pros about this vehicle was the power of the engine, memory seats, great cargo area, built in air compressor, and the towing.

Drove it from Florida to Alaska through Yukon without one hitch. V8 is sharp, powerful, easily passes 18 wheelers on 2 lane roads. Steering is very nimble for an SUV, but a little numb (prob GM-based). Makes u-turns as well as my sport car (in 2 and half lanes). Interior provides nearly every feature a Mercedes SUV does. Good interior size and rear seats fold down for carrying bigger stuff. Performs better than most cars in the snow and ice (use studded snow tires!) due to its immense weight, but the engine doesn't make it feel heavy. 1 and 2 gear perform very well without over revving. Heated seats burn my back! (Good thing w -25 F temp).",4.5

The V8 engine and horsepower are faster then most sport sedans which leaves the other drivers on the road with a surprised look on their faces.

Friends compliment it a lot, and I never see them on the road, although they do look like a lot of cheaper GM cars. Only complaints are wind noise (not sure if it's side mirrors draft or sealing) and gas mileage (15 mpg avg over 15k miles). I don't commute so not such a big deal.

The terrible suspension, the inability to seal sound of air from inside car,the front bumper which popped off due to cheap plastic pins (bumpers cost min $1,250). The pulling out of alingment and told it's normal. Blindspots, backing up you can't see a thing! Needs sensors. My Saab had water leak inside of it from rain.

The awd will not engage until over 20 mph and when driving 0-20mph you have No awd active and this suv goes where it wants when cornering or trying to start up and incline from a dead start. The 9-7X bucks and fishtails and ends up in about a 60 degree angle before if any help comes from the front wheels pulling.  Stay with a true 4x4 with 4high, 4low on the fly option.

You can really notice the change made to the handling by GM.  However, a close family memeber has a GMC Envoy and you really see a lot of the same characteristics in the Saab.  With GM's history I can only guess that how durable the 9-7 will be.  Although, you can't go wrong with the factory offered 4 year bumper to bumper warranty and 3 year service warranty.  These were very appealing at purchase.  In all, I would recommend the Saab, because I do not beleive you will find anything better for your money.",4.375

It is basically like a mini-Cadillac Escalade. Great unique styling sets it apart. On a 1000 mile road trip from OR to CA I didn't see another one on the road. Very plush and comfortable on the inside. As a true Saab afficionado, the ignition location in the center makes me feel like this is the real deal and not just a re-badge. Plenty of power, but acceleration up hills is a bit lackluster, I wish it had a turbo like my old 9-5. Fuel economy on the road trip was the as- advertised 21 mpg, luckily it runs on regular unleaded. All in all, great car with plenty of comfort and room to haul your stuff, plus the ability to tow.

It rides real smooth and has the safety I am looking for.  The seating is very comfortable and offers a lot of room.  I do find everything too compact.  There are not enough areas to store little things.  The gas mileage is not very efficient for todays gas problems.  I average 15.6 miles to the gallon.  That is including both Highway and City driving.  This is a luxury SUV in my opinion.  They offer onStar and satellite radio free for 3 months.  ,4

While it may have more than its share of GM truck infused in it, Saab has made a very creative take on it, and you really don't know you're driving a truck. It rides higher than a car, but it's much easier to get into than the Volvo, Mercedes, or Land Rover SUVs. It also rides better and has more cargo room than the BMW. And it's thousands less than all of those. Even if you're considering an American SUV, check the Saab out and you'll be pleasantly surprised with its quality, impressive handling and performance, and individuality. The interior is worlds better than the Chevy and on par with luxury SUVs.",4.625

The inline six provides plenty of power and the four wheel disc brakes stop it effortlessly without a bit of fade. The interior is neat and clean without excess. The exterior styling is very clean also, the signature Saab front grille and headlight treatments distance it from its GM brethren. Overall great vehicle.",4.875

The throaty V8 sound and associated 300 horse power realing make driving this SUV fun. I am also impressed with the tight turning radias and parking ease which my wife loves. Saab/GM has really made the total package SUV. Saab was smart to make a real five seat vehicle and not a so so third row seven seater which most SUV try to be but fall short.

It's comfortable and can tow over 5000lbs but the drive train is truly dissapointing.  MPG only averages 15 in mixed driving (approx half city/half highway).  There is a noticable lag on acceleration from a stop, then it comes on all at once (are they trying to copy SAAB turbo lag??).  The transmission shifts nervously in city driving, constantly fishing and clunking between gears.  The engine and tranny combo remind me of a 60's Chevy pickup - completely unrefined.

I already have a Trailblazer so I am familiar with the platform.  As you might expect the Saab is much nicer on the inside and has much better handling.
