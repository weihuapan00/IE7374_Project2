0, on 03/16/10 15:52 PM (PDT),Tasirna ,1997 Geo Metro Sedan LSi 4dr Sedan,The little Putt - putt," I bought my first Geo from a friend and fell in love, now 7 years and almost 300,000 miles later it has finally started dying on me. But I love my little putt-putt so much I managed to find another one identical to her with only 100,000 miles on it. These are great little cars and I hate that they are no longer made. Geo had a great product, maybe that's why chevy bought them cause they were scared? (97 Geo Metro 4dr Sedan 1.3 L 4 cyl) and yes they made 4 cyl in 97 contrary to some car parts places.",4.5

2, on 01/26/03 00:00 AM (PST),Kent Bellman ,1997 Geo Metro Sedan LSi 4dr Sedan,Long Hauler," This is the 3rd Geo I have had. I enjoy the excellent gas mileage and the peace of mind that I get when I start it up every day. I know it will always start for me and perform. I bought it used, to help off set the gas consumption of my 99 Silverado. It is easy to tune and oil change. I would recommend it to anyone needing a 2nd dependable car. The after market parts are very expensive.",4.75

4, on 03/29/14 14:03 PM (PDT),alwarren1 ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback 2dr Hatchback,Very dependable," My mom bought this car in 2008 for $1500.00 withonly 30,000 miles on it, she drove it for 3 years, then gave it to me in 2010. I drove it up until March 2014 and it now has a little less than 90K miles. I have never had an expensive, deal breaking issue with it. The only real issues I have had is the headlights are very tricky and wiring kind of sucks, and on a cold -10 degree morning in Alaska, it makes squealing sounds. Other than that it has been an excellent car and very dependable and sturdy. Great gas mileage, could have probably last me another 2 years at the least.",4.125
5, on 08/26/13 16:58 PM (PDT),jveliquette ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback LSi 2dr Hatchback,Can be fun and reliable!, This is my first Geo Metro ever and to be honest i wasn't happy at first when i bought it. Although it grows on you when you get such killer gas mileage and it never breaks down on you. I have a lsi 4cyl 5-speed and i think it's pretty fun to drive and easy to repair. I would recommend this car to anyone if you can stand to not drive the most flashy thing on the streets.,3.25

It seems that the geo is an extremely good or extremely poor purchase.  If you have one, here's some advice: Don't dog it, it's all about using your gears, I climbed Mt. Ashland at 75 mph, since it's a roller skate, the trick is momentum.",3.625

9, on 10/23/06 12:54 PM (PDT),Amy B ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback LSi 2dr Hatchback,I've loved this car!," This is the 2nd Geo Metro (Chevy Sprint) I've driven to over 200,000 miles. I've only had to do routine maintenance and this car is still running on many of the original parts, including engine and clutch. Still gets over 44 mpg. It might be the fastest or most stylish car on the road but I'd buy another in a heartbeat if they were still making them. It's ridiculous to have pay over $20,000 to get a new car that equals the fuel efficiency of this old one. What's wrong with this picture?",4.25
10, on 08/28/05 10:47 AM (PDT),Debradley ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback LSi 2dr Hatchback,My Geo's Eulogy," Well, after 112,000 mile a bad oil leak repair finally killed her, but what a great, cheap car. Up until the last gasp, this car never broke down--I did replace an axel & had some brake work done, but for the first four years nothing but oil changes. I bought this car used with about 40000 miles on it. It was awesome on gas and you could fit a ton of stuff in the hatchback. I'm replacing her with a 2004 Hyundai accent sedan, which is safer, but I'll miss my metro. It was an automatic transmission, and I've never had to repair it. If you are on a budget and can find a clean one with > 80k miles, I say go for it.",4.5
11, on 06/07/03 00:00 AM (PDT),Ted Gauss ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback 2dr Hatchback,Go Metro ," I think these little cars are the ultimate comute car.  I put in 30-40K a year and they keep on going.  They are a great low maintenance car.  I have 142,000 miles and I've done nothing to fix this car yet.  Just new plugs (twice), tires, brakes (twice).  I don't even change the oil but every 3-6 mos (9k-18k miles for me) this is my 2nd hatch back but my third metro and I just bought a 2001 for $3800 w/ only 28,000 mi on it.  I figure it will go at least another 100,000 miles (that's only 4 cents a mile to own) It's just too bad that chevy stopped making them.  I'm currently looking for low mileage 2001 to park / store until I need them.",4.5
12, on 03/12/03 00:00 AM (PST),ncdamsel ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback LSi 2dr Hatchback, a pretty good small car," the seats in this car killed my back,but other than that it was cheap to keep . so that is allways a good thingcheap tires, low payment, the only complaint was not comfortable to drive on long trips,",2.375
13, on 11/05/02 00:00 AM (PST),purtycoolguy ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback 2dr Hatchback,whats to complain about," as far as inexpensive, bought a 97 in 99 for $4500  4 door automatic/air cond...it gets the mileage and has gone from 32k miles to over 88k without complaints..had to put in $100 for air conditioner charge but other than that i am smiling all the way...so what is there to complain about??? it ain't a mercedes, but then again, you ain't paying the payment!!!",4.25
14, on 08/26/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Little Bandita ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback 2dr Hatchback,Economic - Not Exquisite," In terms of achieving my goal, this car has more than met it. I wanted an interim, inexpensive, small, dependable car I could load my keyboard & amp in & out of with relative ease. For 5 years it&#8217;s consistently done the job. Tires, hubcaps, & rear axle have been replaced. After the first year (&#8217;98) I had no air conditioning because the frion ran out. But the heater works great & the gas hikes haven&#8217;t phased me--I&#8217;m still paying less per month than I do for cable TV. It&#8217;s a great little car with surprisingly good pick-up, no slowing on hills, easy on the turns, but tough to park without power steering.",3.25
15, on 08/10/02 00:00 AM (PDT),P. Setlur ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback 2dr Hatchback,Good A to B and B to A car," For a 3 cylinder car, it is pretty decent.  I want to know when the spark plugs have to be changed.  I have about70,000 clicks on it.  Does this car useplatinum plugs?  I bought this secondhand at about 35,000 km..  I recently changed the air filter on it.  I'd appreicate any input from similar owners on its upkeep.  There is no a/c on mine.  I am having a problem with the heating switch that I have to wiggle to make it operate at low speed.  I live in Toronto and I need the heat in winter.",4
16, on 05/11/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Brian Petty ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback LSi 2dr Hatchback,Great Little Car, Bought the car used in 1999 for $6900 with 36000 miles.  I can't seem to get the max fuel economy out of it (even after tune up).  It has never had any major mech problems.,3.875
17, on 04/09/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Benbrilling ,1997 Geo Metro Hatchback LSi 2dr Hatchback,Economical and dependable," In the 2 years I've owned my Geo I have had no problems beyond worn out wiper blades.  It runs smoothly and I the auto-transmission gearing is just right to pull out ahead of the crowd at the stoplights.  It accelerates smoothly and quickly on the uphill to over 65 MPH on the freeway. My overall MPG was good before at 32, and now even better since a tuneup.",4.625

I have had fords,dodge, chevrolets, saab,volkswagon,etc.I was looking for a cheap dependable car to get me too and from college and work and around town. I have taken at least 5 or more trips in it so far with mile ranges of 200 to 1000 miles a weekend. The car gets excellent gas mileage, and I have had no problems exept for normal wear and tear ie:new tires.",4.25
20, on 04/24/12 08:15 AM (PDT),mickmarion ,1997 Geo Tracker SUV 4dr SUV 4WD,"So much fun to drive, roomy and great gas mileage at 26 for the 4x4"," I owned this car second hand from Carmax and had it for 10 years, best little car ever. She was really roomy, loved taking the top off and yes she was noisy but who cares. Heater worked great when I needed it, never had too many issues. Gave her a bath every week and took care of every service that was needed. I would get another in a heartbeat !",5
21, on 12/26/11 13:18 PM (PST),vw1973 ,1997 Geo Tracker SUV 2dr SUV 4WD w/Soft Top,Best Little Car On the Market," I bought my Tracker for $1750; it had 73,800 miles on it, ran awesome, and was in good shape for a 14 year old car. One of the best moves I've ever made. In the winter it's great because it has 4x4 and is amazing in the snow. In the summer it's great because it's a convertible and it's surprisingly phenomenal off-road, even when completely stock. It's durable and can handle lots of work. For such a small car it can fit 1/3 cord of wood, and you won't wreck the strong interior. It's uncomfortable and 55mph on the highway is 3K rpm, but it gets 35 mpg, it's amazingly reliable, and it has the heart and soul of a big truck.",4.25
22, on 04/25/11 11:46 AM (PDT),lukebecker ,1997 Geo Tracker SUV 4dr SUV 4WD,BRAKES SUCK!!!," I bought this for about 6K and Hated it.The 4x4 worked ok, but is sits low to the ground so when I tried to go over snow banks (WI) I would get hung up and which the 4 wheel couldn't pull me off of.I am 6 foot tall and talk about rough sitting in this thing.My leg was always pushing on the center counsel thing.No cruise.didn't hold its value for crap.And I (who has been driving sticks for his whole life) ""Burnt the clutch out"" before the car hit 100K.Only car that ""I"" have ever ""broke.""",3
23, on 07/20/10 20:27 PM (PDT),Gil ,1997 Geo Tracker SUV LSi 4dr SUV 4WD, A Surprising Dependable little SUV," This SUV does what it is suppose to do, get you there on time every time whether it be the big snow storm or ice storm. It is very dependable for a 1997. Yes it rides like a truck or Jeep. The vehicle sits high so very high wind days are a no-no at high speeds on I87. Gas mile is great for a 1.6 liter 5 speed manual shift. 24-MPG city and 33 MPG on the highway. I get stuck doing stuff for my daughter who lives about 90 North and the vehicle has ample room for stuff like bikes, pallets, computers, snow blowers lawn mowers  mulch etc. I have replaced these items, battery, muffler, brakes tie rod and a brake line, tuneup fluids and bulbs(easy jobs). I turned off the driving light to save energy",3.875

Veh)"," I bought this candy apple red little beauty from my neighbor who seemed to enjoy filling it with trash. It had no dents or dings and after we jump- started it, it ran fantastic.  KNowing he bought a new car since his wife was pregnant, I immediately approached him and struck a deal for $500.00 dollars.  The front drivers door hing failed, it had a hole in the exhaust, a check engine light was on, (o2 sensor)AND the rear window was stolen along with the Alpine stereo Steve put in (bad idea on a convertible) So, I put $500.00 in it and fixed everything it needed to pass emissions and inspection. After that..it has run FANTASTIC. I love it!!!! 30 mpg, new tires, just needs radio!!!  ",3.875
26, on 11/01/08 23:44 PM (PDT),russ ,1997 Geo Tracker SUV 2dr SUV 4WD w/Soft Top,"Fun, Fun, Fun!"," Bought this car because I need to rent a car for two weeks while my other was being repaired. It was only $1,400 and had been used as a tow vehicle behind a motorhome. Came with a soft and hard top. Gave my 15 year old his first driving lesson it it (has a 1.6L motor and 5 speed trans). When he gets his license he can buy it from me. I hyper mile better than 38 mpg out of this car around town, but freeways speeds can get scary. Overall it's a great little runabout. Too bad they don't make them anymore. ",4.375
27, on 02/23/08 10:11 AM (PST),Richard  Smythe ,1997 Geo Tracker SUV LSi 4dr SUV,97 Geo in Florida.," I originally bought my 97 Geo Tracker LSI 4dr Wagon from a local auto recycler a little over 1 year ago. I replaced the fuel pump, tires and battery and have driven 12,345 miles since. The car had 111,567 miles on it when I started driving it. I like most of the car's features except for the constant headlights feature (I actually consider it dangerous because only the headlamps come on without the running lamps. I have several times driven without all the lights on).  I feel the car is underpowered. I would trade a little gas mileage for more get up and go! I usually get 30-35 MPG. I love the car otherwise. The side opening rear door is great. I have had no breakdowns.",4.25

29, on 01/19/07 00:14 AM (PST),Brian ,1997 Geo Tracker SUV LSi 4dr SUV 4WD,97 Tracker," I have put 200,000 miles on this 5 spd 4WD Tracker and consider it to be trouble free and cheap to drive. The worst that I have gotten was 27 MPG and that was in 4WD on snow. I get between 30 and 35 MPG with every tank. Maint: replaced the front brakes 3 times, rear brakes 2 times; starter and alternator once; tires every 45,; just replaced the speedometer cluster because the speedometer quit working; some light bulbs have never been replaced. If a vehicle lasts this long in WV it's a good design. I'll be looking for a newer Tracker in another 50K or so.",4

I wanted black but we ended up with the dull red one, my wife loves it, I accepted it, it is her car! We had them add remote locks, but it came loaded, CD prim, pwr everything except seats. It has 130k and we changed: brakes, front autohub to manual (auto were too expensive, though it came with auto) O2 sensors-2x, complete exhaust-converter, tires so over all that is great! We did have to redo the AC. The gate lift handle cover fell off, put back. Wife loves it, I am crippeled with bad back, more than 30 miles I have to have a pain hypo! Not good on windy days! Rust on bottom-rockers/quarters.",4.25

Dealer will gladly break your bank replacing everything and you will still have the problem, arghh!  I think the culprit is carbon accumulating in the egr valve port.",3.75
32, on 09/29/05 08:22 AM (PDT),Alecia Mason ,1997 Geo Tracker SUV 2dr SUV w/Soft Top,"Go little Tracker, GO!"," Not bad for a such a tiny little truck. I recently bought a 1997 and I love it. Interior is comfortable, although for someone bigger than me (5'2"" or taller) may find driver seat umcomfortable. Convertible top takes time to put up or down, but is very nice on those hot days. I drive an hour and a half to school or work everyday and highway driving is pleasant, however, high-speed passing power is only ""acceptable"" in my 5- speed. Gas mileage is a bonus, with the amount I save on gas from a V8 S10 pickup, my loan really does pay itself off! It's an awesome little truck, I must say. Unfortunately, all my friends with pickups have dubbed it ""The little truck that thought it could....but couldn't""",4

Just don't try to drive it like a sports car in the corners and hold on with both hands when driving in the wind.  If you can live with the stiff ride, it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

41, on 08/03/15 19:48 PM (PDT),Leslie ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,"315,000 miles, and I still can't scrap it"," I inherited my 1997 Geo Prizm from my father when I was 16 years old (I'm currently 26). At the time it had already been in his possession for 7 years. It was a stick shift. I learned with no RPM gauge, and I attest to date that it is the best car to learn stick on; it's industrial strength, you learn by sound and feel, and the clutch isn't very sensitive. It's now a 19 year old car, and has 315,000 miles on it. It has taken me on multiple round trips from Columbus to Chicago and DC, and I still drive it safely on multi (3 +) hour trips. I have invested very little until these last final two years in repairs. (Most issues are general wear/age issues, the most recent my sad reality check--rusted brake lines). I haven't calculated mileage in a minute, but several years ago it was *still* running over 37 mpg. It is so well loved that I can't stand to trade it in, and will be giving it away to a friend, who says that even at 315k miles it is more reliable than his own vehicle.",5

I have owned mine for 5 years and she has owned it for 8 years. I have the LSi and she has the standard model. We both have the 1600 standard engine. Both cars extremely reliable. Cost of ownership very low. Both are cars are salvaged and cost under $3,000. Other than normal maintenance have had 1 fuel injector replaced, starter motor. I switched the passenger seat with the drivers seat to increase seat comfort. Negative - Road noise, a little bit louder than other small cars I have owned, but a small issue overall. ",5

It has almost 194,000 miles on it, and I bought it used in '98 with a little over 5,000. These are some hard earned NJ miles with generally bad road conditions and extremes in weather. I love its reliability! In fact I'm replacing the timing belt this week -- overdue, I know -- with intentions of taking it as far as I can. But a word of advice: if you have an automatic, get the differential oil checked as well as the transmission. I've learned very little about cars since I've had this Prizm, but that was one big expensive lesson.",4.625

I have driven this car from NY to FL twice and NY to Chicago round- trip.  It hits its max at 175,000, but what car that you have can you say the same.  If you find it in low mileage, buy immediately because it will last a long time.  It's too bad they discontinued the brand because I would have definitely bought another one.",3.75
46, on 08/12/09 09:42 AM (PDT),Jim ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,Has there ever been a better car?????," I bought this car new late in the model year (12 years ago).  I have spent a max of $1000 in this time period on minor repairs.  It still gets 38 mpg+ with the 5-speed manual transmission. So given this is a 13- year old car, why aren't new cars much better?

47, on 06/29/09 22:27 PM (PDT),dercpi ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,still going strong," Hands down, the best vehicle I have ever owned due to its reliability and cost savings.  The styling remains fresh if not fresher today than some of the crap being built now. My first was a 1994 LSi lease. It, too, was flawless. I drove my '97 off the showroom floor with 3/10's of a mile on it. As of today, it has exactly 310,000 miles on it! The engine and transmission remain original as does the exhaust and most of the suspension. The fit and finish remain strong as does the interior.  Not bad considering it has never been garaged. It still gets great gas mileage, burns very little oil and has no squeaks.  Why this model/line was ever killed off beats me. Wake up GM, you blew it.       ",4.625
48, on 01/29/09 11:04 AM (PST),RON ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,Great car," Bought this car in July of 08, when gas hit about 3.50 a gal. Parked the truck 15 miles per gal.  I live in Minnesota, so it gets cold, car sits outside for one week solid it was above 20 below without the wind chill, started always and not only that still got good gas mileage about 32 city. In the summer I was getting 35, but not freeway. On the freeway driving 55 to 60, got 42 eat your heart out Prius, and I didn't need to spend 20 grand or more, car is paid for",4.75
49, on 08/08/08 19:56 PM (PDT),geo prizm ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,built to last," Bought my first Prizm in 97 and put 200,000 miles on it. I then sold it too my sister in law and she still drives it today. At the time I sold it to her it was still on the original everything. Only replaced one cv joint and brake job usual tuneups but everything else is original to the car. She now has well over 250,000 on it and still drives it to school everyday. I bought another 97 at a great price with a 100,000 and am sure to get another 100,000. Can't go wrong with these cars \ 94-97 models",5

My first was a 92 and this one a 97, and I have had no major problems with either. In the 97 there have been a couple problems with the O2 sensor, but it is a mechanically sound car. Also after being around since 97, there has been some recently developing paint peeling. But this car has survived being driven hard, and will take care of you.",4.75
51, on 07/24/08 05:19 AM (PDT),mike ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan LSi 4dr Sedan,big time gas mileage, I got this car from my mother. It's the 1.8 auto. My gas mileage is incredible. Hwy mileage is anywhere from 40-44 mpg and combined is about 38. Given I'm not a jack rabbit driver and I use synthetic oil in this car.  Its the first time I ever got better gas mileage than what is advertised. I will never sell this car.,3.875
52, on 03/23/08 17:35 PM (PDT),Quackingpenguin ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,Best first car for a kid!," This was an amazing little car. I bought it in 2005 because i was sick of not having a car at school. In the 2 and a half years I drove it I put about 75,000 miles on it with out any big issues. I hit a deer and did much less damage to the car then I had expected, and it was CHEAP and EASY to fix. My dad liked this car because we could do a lot of the work ourselves. The only down side was it was hard to find  replacement parts for like the body of it. It turned 200,000 miles and that is the only reason I sold it. I bet it has another 100,000 left in it!

53, on 11/21/07 08:11 AM (PST),Geoyta Owner ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan LSi 4dr Sedan,Not the Reliability Expected," We purchased it used with 77K. It's been driven 42K in 6 years, mostly city. It's been maintained by the book (severe service schedule). The 3-speed automatic transmission makes highway driving unpleasant (noisy at high rpms). Mpg is 25 city/30 highway. Repairs have included a rebuilt transmission with a new differential and rebuilt torque converter ($2400), heater core ($800), two half-shaft axles ($700), and a starter ($300). Repairs are averaging $.1/mile. This vehicle has a Toyota drivetrain. It has not met the Toyota reputation for reliability.",2.25
54, on 08/31/07 18:23 PM (PDT),Jerry ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,Tough as Nails!!, I bought my Prizm in 1998. Just like the energizer bunny says It keeps going and going and going. Regular oil changes every 3 months and tire rotations make this car a piece of cake to own. I love driving by gas stations as those big SUVs are sucking down the juice!!,4.875
55, on 07/18/07 13:53 PM (PDT),hbr ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan LSi 4dr Sedan,"Ok, but could be better"," Left outer CV joint/boot failed.  Starter failed.  Heater core leaked ($800).  Wheel covers flew off. Tape deck failed.  The 3-speed automatic transmission is beginning to exhibit vagueness/hunting on deceleration/coasting. Overall, this vehicle is a decent, get- round-town appliance. On surface streets its acceleration, handling, braking, and noise/vibration are acceptable. The car is hard pressed to cruise above 65 mph with considerable engine noise. Fuel economy is about 25 mpg city and 30 mpg highway. The engine is tight and does not burn oil. The car has passed every emissions test. ",3
56, on 07/10/07 08:35 AM (PDT),jrexo's baby ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,The best car that I've ever owned," I've been driving for 50 yrs. now, and have owned a lot of cars during this time. My 1997 Geo Prizm, which I have been driving for 9 yrs now, is absolutely the best car that I have ever owned, I have had zero problems, only the starter replaced, after 9 yrs. and a set of tires is all.  I love my Geo Prizm.  If anyone out there needs to buy a used car, I suggest this Geo, you'll love it",4.875
57, on 07/01/07 17:37 PM (PDT),Janice ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan LSi 4dr Sedan,Reliability!!!," I love my Prizm. It has 182,000 miles and has not let me down.  It is has withstood lots of wear and tear due to an immense amount of driving.  I did have to replace the tires a few times, but that could be due to the amount of miles I put on each year. ",4.375
58, on 10/12/06 20:29 PM (PDT),Bob ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,Great car," Bought this car in 1999 and I have driven it almost 90,000 miles. From cold NY winters to hot Las Vegas summers, this car has never left me stranded by the roadside. ",4.75
59, on 08/17/06 14:16 PM (PDT),Ringer ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,Great Mileage," I am impressed by the great mileage; with auto and air on, I still had 33 mpg. However, this car takes dents easily. The interior has cheap plastic that breaks. The tailgate plastic under latch is broken as is plastic under vinyl on car door rest. I personally find the car too low for me. But I am 55. Younger people would like the low-slung look and low bucket seats. I did not realize the rear window did not have a wiper until after I purchased it. (May  not come with one in any style.)",4
60, on 07/18/06 13:55 PM (PDT),Yak ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,Dependable, Not a very peppy 105 HP engine but it is easy to work on and pretty efficient.  It can get 38 MPG on the highway.  Hopefully it's good for another 50K miles,4.25

Have done all regular maintenance and going great!  good acceleration even at high speeds.  fun for motoring! :)  easy to drive in rain/snow--corrects easily from a skid.  sturdy build--I can't believe the stuff I've run over or hit with this car over the years and it's still driving fine and looks great!

62, on 03/16/06 17:49 PM (PST),Matt ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,Great econo-box," Great little car - got it 1 year ago w/80K, now has close to 100K.  Handles and drives nice for a compact.  Seems to be well-built and reliable.  No problems other than routine maintenance- this is surprising considering that it seems like the previous owner beat up on it pretty good.  Perfect car for getting around town, not as ideal for highway cruising.  Good gas mileage. Buy one if you want a Toyota Corolla, but are looking for something a little cheaper.",4.75
63, on 08/08/05 18:46 PM (PDT),Amber ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan 4dr Sedan,The Awesome Prizm (My baby), This is one of the best reliable cars that I have ever owned.  It has outlasted a Toyota Camry and a Honda Civic.  It will probably outlast my brand new Hyundai Santa Fe!!!,5
64, on 07/27/05 21:42 PM (PDT),Gene Rager ,1997 Geo Prizm Sedan LSi 4dr Sedan,My little Red Prism," I presently have 178000 miles on my Prizm and it runs as good today as the day I bought it.  I have not sufferred any major problems at all.  I am 6'4"" tall and I can wear my western styled hat while I drive.  I routinely get 37 miles per gallon.  This is a combination of city and hiway driving. I manage this milage on midrange gasoline.  Based on the foregoing I do not understand why the car was discontinued.  My next car shall be as close to the Prizm that I can get.  Thank you   ",5

When are you going to *need* 120 mph, or to go 60 in less than 6 seconds?  The Prizm gets us around town and from state to state without any trouble.  It may not be the fastest ride on the road, but you can't beat it for reliability.  Also, we got japanese engineering for an american price.  We'll drive this thing well over 200K miles.",4.5

There are a few things it's surprising to see in this car's class, chiefly the tremendous upholstery work.

The car was fixed and you can't even tell.  The ride is great, only problem is acceleration, but with the manual tranny it makes it a little easier to bear.  I am a former Ford owner and even though I got 200k miles on my escort (and it's still running) I would never buy a ford again.  Too bad they stopped making the prizm, it's a great car and I would consider buying a newer one once I am out of college.",4.75

As far as utilitarian, this car has been great.  It always starts and gets an average of 30 miles per gallon and 42mpg on the highway.

Great mileage too.",4.375
