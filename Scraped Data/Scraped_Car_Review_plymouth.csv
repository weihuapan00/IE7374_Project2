0, on 07/31/08 23:09 PM (PDT),Raj ,1999 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,1999 Plymouth Neon 4 Dr Highline Sedan," The first 6 years went fine. In 2005 all the problems started, the car stalled half a dozen times between repeated trips to the dealership. They replaced the head gasket, timing belt, starter cables, spark plugs, ignition cables, rear main seal. Finally, they found a faulty relay due to the AC compressor which also was replaced. In Feb 2007 the vehicle would not start. Guess what? They replaced the fuel pump too. I've spend over $5000 in repairs. Now the vehicle stalls intermittently, the engine hesitates and jerks. The hp is gone. Do not buy this vehicle.  It's proof that domestic vehicles are absolute junk. The Neon was so bad it was discontinued after the 2005 model. Nightmare!",2.75
1, on 07/26/08 06:04 AM (PDT),th neon ,1999 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,Pretty good car," I bought this Neon as my first car, and as a teenage guy I wasn't sure I wanted such a wimpy car. Well, I have had it over a year now, and I love it to death. I have had two small problems with it, the starter motor gave out, and the power locks are giving out. Other than that, it has been a great car. I love the stock sound system, the 6X9's in the back are awesome, but I did put in a new head unit, and now it sounds even better. I also put new hubcaps on becuase the stock ones where hideous. (the graffiti interior pattern is also very ugly, but seat covers can fix that). Great car if you want to put a little bit of creativity into it.",3.875
2, on 06/13/08 22:53 PM (PDT),Craig ,1999 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,Not a bad car," This was my second car ever. Went in, had a fun drive with it, and bought it. Only major issue was the head gasket leak which was caused by a poor design. Replaced the old head gasket with a new MLS one, no problem since. A minor issue was a new valve cover gasket replaced after 75k miles. $30 and 30 minutes in your driveway will take care of this, no big deal. This was my first Neon of two and I plan on buying another. They're fairly common part cars and easy to fix. I love the DOHC engine but the 3-speed automatic can be a slouch at times. Keep up with your oil changes and a Neon will last you a long time. ",3.875
3, on 05/06/05 23:34 PM (PDT),neonrob99 ,1999 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,My Neon, The only thing that I don't really like is auto transmission and the mirror in the driver's side visor. The 3 speed just isn't quick enough.,3.625
4, on 05/30/04 00:00 AM (PDT),lv my neon ,1999 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,neons are reliable for single moms, I love my noen I first got one when i was 16 shortly after got rid of it reasons unknown but after my divorce i was stranded with no car being a single mom with two kids money is tight and i found the neon very afordable only problem they are in the top ten cars stolen as i found out when mine was taken. They should all come with alarms,4.75
5, on 10/09/03 00:00 AM (PDT),markcherry ,1999 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,I love my little Neon," I've driven my car across the country a few times, and after 175,000, it's still running great.  For the most part, it's been reliable and fun to drive. I've had to make two semi-major repairs ($500 each), but that seems pretty good considering the mileage.  I would imagine anyone who takes care of this car having an enjoyable experience.",4
6, on 09/24/03 00:00 AM (PDT),D. Lee ,1999 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,My Neon," This is my first car, but my last choice. I bought it in Ohio where there are virtually no hills. The real test would be the roads in New York my new home.  It has surpassed all of my expectations.  It handles the roads here with no problems, also easy to handle with the front-wheel drive in the snow, easy and fun to drive and still looks brand new. If you take care of it, it will serve you well. The only problem was the moon roof motor had to be replaced a year later. The overall performance is great unless the air conditioning is on.  It is a great first choice. When I decide to buy another car, I will not trade this one in.",4.625
7, on 04/22/03 00:00 AM (PDT),Davkuy ,1999 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,Believer," When I first went to buy a car I was looking for a used Toyota.  The dealership told me about a good deal they had running on Neon's.  I almoast turned around and walked out, thinking the Neon was a ""disposable car"" but I decided to try it.  The only 5 speed they had on the Lot was a tricked out expresso with most of the goodies.  As soon as I got it out on the road, the car was sold.  Recently 4/03 I traded it for a Toyota corolla, (Big Mistake)  repairable mistake thank goodness.",4.5
8, on 07/25/10 15:40 PM (PDT),kristie2021 ,1999 Plymouth Neon Coupe Expresso 2dr Coupe,Crap," I was really shocked to see all the good reviews for a car that was nothing but trouble for me. It recently broke down on me and I had to get rid of it. When I bought it the only thing was wrong with it was the radiator and a gas leak, I had many other problems, I had to replace the battery, the tires(more than 10x), the starter, the water pump, the cylinder, and the spark plugs. The spark plugs went out and stripped my cylinders in my engine, with the motor mounts going bad as well. It was like a domino effect in 2 weeks. The brake line, motor mounts,and then finally the spark plugs. It was a complete and total piece of crap and right before it broke down, there was acceleration on its own.",3.375
9, on 03/17/04 00:00 AM (PST),NeoNxGrL ,1999 Plymouth Neon Coupe Expresso 2dr Coupe,Roxy," Fun little car to drive-gets great gas mileage.  Easy to handle and great first car.  Got mine a couple days after Christmas & was my first car.  Wasnt my first choice, but once I started driving it, I instantly took a liking to it.",3.625
10, on 01/11/03 00:00 AM (PST),Flight ,1999 Plymouth Neon Coupe Expresso 2dr Coupe,OK," I purchased my 99 Neon in August of 99. I have had no real problems with it. It is very small and is a tight fit for more than 2 in the back. I am concerned with its saftey and will trade if off soon. She has 81k miles and is still running ok. I do keep my oil changed and the only thing I have had to put on it is tires. There is an odd whistle comming from under the hood, but I think its a belt.",3.375
11, on 11/13/12 06:18 AM (PST),jacki_chan73 ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,I hate it," This car is terrible. I have owned it for about a year and a half and it sucks. I have to work on it constantly, and have had to make many repairs. The dash will quit working and the only way to fix it is to push on the glass to get it working, and even then the speedometer goes crazy. It is a zippy car, but it shakes really bad if you go 60 or above, which sucks for long drives. The interior isn't so bad, but if you're tall like me, opt for a different car, leg room sucks and it's pretty much on the ground, I have to practically roll out of the car to get out. I've replaced the tires, spark plugs, battery four times (for some reason it shorted out constantly, really bad wiring)",2.5
12, on 07/11/10 20:44 PM (PDT),Ana ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Best Car I've Had so Far!, I'm seeing a lot of comments about the head gasket breaking and i have never had that problem before. the car makes a lot of noise when you accelerate but once you get to your speed it drives great. its a fast little bugger! on the highway it starts to shake at about 70 but is ultra smooth. have never had to replace anything major expect the radiator and cooling fans. for the past 3 years the FM reception doesn't work but i don't really mind even though I'm thinking of replacing the radio. the only thing i really dislike is that after having it for 6 years it has started to rust on the roof and the paint is chipping off. it doesn't give it an appealing look.,4.375
13, on 03/10/10 12:06 PM (PST),Macon ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Never Again," It's just not worth the time in the shop to own one. I got mine with 52,000 miles on it. It now has 96,000 and I'm already rebuilding the top end. I've replaced the EGR valve, catalytic converter, CV half shaft, transmission, and many other things. It is the slowest 4 cylinder on the planet with the three speed automatic and I only get about 24 mpg ON A 4 CYLINDER!",1.625
14, on 05/02/09 16:06 PM (PDT),Elizabeth H ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Style 4dr Sedan,It was fun once," I bought this car in 2004. I LOVED it for the first 2.5-3 years I had it. At first the only problems I had with it were the windshield wipers (which have never seemed to fit right) and the tires (I've had 2-5 flats a year, which probably have more to do with me than the car). Since early 2008 I've had a lot of problems. In the past year I've had the brakes worked on four times, one of the rotars replaced, the headlights fixed (twice?), etc. Last year I spent $2,000 fixing this car. Also, the speakers don't work, none of the engine lights work, the vents leak air, and the windows won't close all the way. (This may be normal for a 10- year old car with 120,000 miles on it.)",4.125
15, on 04/29/08 14:25 PM (PDT),Mark ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,Wait," This car has givin me nothing but major trouble. I bought it slightly used at 2,102 miles and after 5 days of owning it my sunroof quit. The next 3 years the transmission made gringing noises. This car stinks!",2
16, on 04/02/08 18:01 PM (PDT),Dan the Man ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,Fun and Fast," My Neon has been a blast to drive. From the moment you touch the throttle and hear the engine roar, to the smooth cornering on the back roads of PA, even to an occasional street race or two, this car has some serious get up and go! The fuel mileage on the highway is impressive!",4.875
17, on 08/15/05 21:29 PM (PDT),Steph ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,"Great fun, but..."," I bought my Plymouth Neon brand new. I loved the blue exterior and the confetti interior. The CD player and sunroof just rounded out my love for this car. I still love to look at it! My only problem is the transmission is slipping and I had to get new air conditioning last summer. Other than those 2 expensive repairs, I have only had to worry about maintenance. ",4.375
18, on 01/27/05 17:42 PM (PST),GPE ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,Worth every Penny, I have just purchased a 1999 Plymouth Neon as a first car.  The only thing I have driven before this was a Hyundai Santa Fe and a Pickup Truck.  The Neon has excellent gas milage.  The only thing that I dislike about it is that it is very low to the ground and mine lacks a sun roof.  Otherwise I think this car is great.  I love the fabric on the seats.  I was expecting somehting plain but this has a design with many different colors.,4.875
19, on 03/22/04 00:00 AM (PST),Neon Lover17 ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,The Neon's not so bad!!!!," Yes, I had the common head gasket problem, but it was fixed at no cost to me, and I had an oil leak, so what, I fixed it for $20. I've had no other problems with it, and I've put over 100K miles on the car! So all the one's who's bashing the neon are over exaggerating. The car has a a problem or two, there is NO SUCH THING as a car with no problems. There just isn't on out that is maintenance free! You can look 'til your eyes fall out, you just won't find one!",4.125
20, on 02/18/04 00:00 AM (PST),fantaR ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,1998 expresso ," I bought my neon in 2000 and ive had only a couple problems with it. It had 30,000 miles on it and about 1 yr after owning it, the head gasket broke. The dealership replaced it but it would of been spending if not. I really like mine cuz it's sporty and handles really nice. The only other problem is that I it gets really cold where I live and sometimes it won't start in the early morning, it just needs a little warming. But over all I love mine but Id rather have a mustang. ",4.375
21, on 11/30/03 00:00 AM (PST),El ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Voice from the dealer," I am a used car dealer and always try to sell quality import and some domestic cars.After i have bought and sold a couple Neons i relized that this vehicle is pain in a ass.Oil leaking at 30000 miles?Blown head gaskets?They are cheap ofcourse to buy,but you have to repair them  and you get what you pay for.I refuse to sell these cars and would not recomend them to anyone.The funny thing is.....people still looking to buy them for kids all the time,because they are cheap.Get a Camry",1.75

23, on 09/22/03 00:00 AM (PDT),MDH ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Good Car," For the first 20K miles no trouble.  Head gasket started leaking, but was repaired under warranty at no cost.  20K to 83K miles, no trouble.  Put on tires, oil changes, wiper blades and a new battery. 50K miles replaced front rotors and pads $65.00 doing the work myself.  83K miles rear main seal leaks bad.  $350.00 at the dealer.  Auto trans. shifting problem.  Dealer said problem was a shaft on trans. shift lever and gas pedal connected to.  Told to spray shaft with WD-40 and move it until it moved freely. $0.00  84.5K replaced rear brake drums and shoes.  $80.00.  I have had good service from my Neon.

It has more pick-me-up than other cars in its class. The head gasket did blow and was repaired under warranty. The other problem I've had is the ""check engine soon"" light comes on frequently. However, it has mostly turned out to be software updates for the CPU of the car.  The other problem I had is that the sunroof stopped working after about three years... it would open and then not close! I just stopped using it.

26, on 07/27/03 00:00 AM (PDT),Don't buy ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Don't buy," I second the other comments about thehead gasket going in all Neons madebefore 2000.  Mine went at 60,000 milesand oil still leaks. I've also had poorfuel economy since then. I also have atrunk that leaks when it rains.  Thereason I will never buy another Chryslercar is the fact that the sun/moon roofhas never worked over 30 days.  When Ifirst had the car under warrenty theyreplaced the sunroof 4 times!!  Once thewarrenty ran out they refused to fix iteven though it was clearly evident thatit is a defect on their part.  Althoughas a friend told me--why bother if theycouldn't fix it the first 4 times who'sto say they'd do it right anyways.",2.875
27, on 04/30/03 00:00 AM (PDT),tiuska ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Think twice!!!!," I had only have problems with this car.  Once, I almost crash because the car stopped in a highway (problems with the gas pump!!!) less that 18 months after I got itThe design is fun but the car is not reliable, everything that can go wrong with a car will be wrong with this one",2.125
28, on 04/21/03 00:00 AM (PDT),drh ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,Great Little Car," I've found my neon to be highly reliable and fun to drive.  My only ""problem"" with the car has been the repetitive occurrance of the ""check engine soon"" light coming on.  There has never been a real problem - only the inconvenience.",4.875
29, on 06/18/02 00:00 AM (PDT),neonite ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Expresso 4dr Sedan,still rolling," I've had nothing but fun and good luck with my neon.  I've put 130,000 hard miles on it and nothing major has gone wrong yet.  I feel like the car is a bit underpowered at low rpm's, but it's pretty peppy once you get it rapped up.  If I was going to do it over again, I would opt for the five-speed over the auto trans just because it is hard to keep the engine in its power band when you only have three gears.  But even with the automatic, if you step on it, it will go.",4.25
30, on 05/20/02 00:00 AM (PDT),DontBuyThisCar ,1998 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Ehhhhh," My neon was fine when I brought it home but soon after the head gasket had to be replaced because of faulty materials used in manufacturing. I did some research and discovered this same material was used in all neons from 95-99, so all Neons before 2000 have the potential for this happening to them. After it was replaced, everything started coming apart and I've had about 5 things replaced on the engine. I have had an oil leak since this all happened and the dealership cannot find out why, they have all been a pain in my butt ever since I bought this thing. I will never buy from Dodge again! Beware, if you buy a neon, dont buy one from before 2000.",3

It is not a pleasure to drive, and I hate the way it looks, inside and out.  It's a good first-car, but even then I wouldn't recommend it.",2.125
32, on 02/10/07 10:32 AM (PST),Griffin ,1998 Plymouth Neon Coupe Highline 2dr Coupe,Low quality car," My fiancee has this car.  It only has 62,000 miles on it and it looks, runs, and drives like it has 162,000 miles on it.  It has rusted completely through already in some spots, it sounds horrible, and vibrates and shakes very bad.  It only has a 3-speed automatic, so freeway cruising is at over 3000rpm, which makes for a very loud drive.  The ride is very rough and unsettled.",3.125
33, on 11/16/03 00:00 AM (PST),buyerbeware ,1998 Plymouth Neon Coupe Expresso 2dr Coupe,Think Twice before buying," Like some of the others, I have had gaskets replaced numerous times and still they cant' get it right.  I have had a sun roof that has been replace 3 times and is still broken which is not under warrenty and the dealer will not fix. The engine light comes on very every 3-4 months due to carbon build up on some sensor which the dealer can't seem to fixed.  I would not reccommend this car to anyone.  Buyer beware. ",2.375

The head gasket blew at 13,000 miles only. The horn stopped working after a few months. The passenger side window was leaking.  My lastest issue is the transmission!

38, on 11/09/12 20:47 PM (PST),lmatracia ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Loved my first car," My dad got my first car, 2000 Plymouth Neon, with 44k for $3500 in 2010. The only major problem I ever encountered was the radiator went out at about 60k (which is VERY typical). I also had the tie rod end snap, but that was only because when the original owner replaced it they put the wrong part on. Overall I loved this car, i never worried about it breaking down and it got great mpg. Very reliable and worth the money. Unfortunately it was wrecked in the front end when someone hit me in a truck head on and drove off, i only had state minimum so was unable to fix the car. :( was very sad to see it go. I now drive a 2000 pt cruiser (which i also enjoy driving)",4.375

I will def get another when it does kick it! Had a Ford contour for a yr and it had 7 recalls on it. Not secure in driving. Had this car 9 yrs. Give or take. Not one recall! ",4.875
40, on 06/11/10 17:09 PM (PDT),Crzy8 ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Best car I've ever owned," Owned and driven for about 7 years; average daily commute of 70 miles. Purchased at 60,000 miles; now at 163,000 and going strong. It's had a chronic oil leak since around 90,000 - tried to have a couple different mechanics chase it down, but it's deep in the engine and repair estimate was more than half the $4,000 I paid for the car. But it runs fine and I don't mind a little incontinence. Otherwise, it handles nice, always starts, and has been extremely low maintenance. ",4.5
41, on 01/15/10 03:33 AM (PST),Traverse City ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,LOVE my car," I purchased my neon brand new, and have yet to have anything mechanical go wrong.  Only normal upkeep on the usual things like breaks. I'm around 145,000 miles now and plan on driving it til it dies, which I'm sure won't be for another few years.  The only things that have gone wrong have all been electrical.  Motor burned out in the moon roof switch, 1 speaker has a vibration sound in it, and first cd changer didn't work but was replaced the first month of ownership and has worked fine ever since.  I would absolutely purchase another Plymouth and am sad that they are no longer made.  Also, my first car was a Plymouth, Reliant and was also a very reliable car.",5
42, on 11/01/09 07:47 AM (PST),JustinP ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,My First Car," I bought this car for 1500 and despite having only one previous owner, this person didn't do ANY maintenance on the car, and left all of that up to the next owner, me. The front power windows haven't worked since the purchase. A/C went out after 1 year. Chipping paint is pretty common on the front bumper. The front passenger speaker blew around 80k mi, and the in-dash speaker on the same side went as well around 92k. I have all aftermarket speakers in the car now. I had problems with the alternator twice, but only had to replace it once. It is comfy however; lots of room for 5 passengers. The CD changer broke on me when I tried playing burnt CDs, which lead to the replacement of the stereo. ",3
43, on 01/03/09 03:01 AM (PST),KTB ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Great Car for Low Cost," Good-looking, comfortable car with great gas mileage. Almost steered clear of buying a Neon, not sure why, but thought they had a junky reputation until I researched the vehicle and found the 2000 year and beyond to have great consumer satisfaction.  My daughter and I love this car for its price range. We have been very happy with ours.",4.75
44, on 12/05/08 10:28 AM (PST),MadScotsMan ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,It's a shame they stopped making these!," This car was originally purchased for my wife in 2002. I have been driving it regularly since 2006. It has 122,000 miles on it it runs like a champ. No major issues at all. I drive about 50% dirt roads and it handles great in all road/weather conditions...particularly good in snow with good tires. I drive in some pretty awful conditions and am quite confident in the Neon. This has proven to be one of the most reliable, fun to drive and economical cars I've ever purchased.  The only problem I've had is leaky window and trunk seals. I look forward to many more enjoyable miles out of this fun and terribly underrated car. Excellent rally-cross capabilities!",4.625
45, on 11/03/08 18:36 PM (PST),Dink2008 ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Not the safest car," I just received this car from my parents and I absolutely dislike it. When driving it, I can never feel comfortable because it does not feel like a safe car at all. The vehicle is thrown all over the road and has no power while going uphill. On the other hand the gas mileage is pretty fair, and the sound is alright. Over all I believe there are more downs than ups for this car and I would not recommend it if you are looking for a safe car. ",2.125

47, on 06/09/08 12:53 PM (PDT),MadScotsMan ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,Perfect $4.00 a Gallon Car," We purchased the Neon in 2002 with 12,000 miles.  It now has 113,000 miles and contrary to what some might say, this has been a reliable, fun and economical car.  I still average over 30 mpg, my best being 39.9 on a long highway trip.  There have been no unusual repairs, just the normal repairs.  At 113k, I have finally replaced the springs, struts and stabilizer bars (went with SRT4 springs/bars/STS)and am in need of brakes.  That's it.  This is the fifth Neon in my family and I'd definitely buy another if they were still made. Great car, a blast to drive, good in snow and really reliable...and I am in no way easy on cars!  ",4.5
48, on 04/21/08 06:59 AM (PDT),Robert ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,Best car purchase I've made," Bought new with 14 miles on it, 7 were my test drive, the other 7 were at the plant as it was a Quality Control test car.  I get 30 miles to the gallon, regularly driving 120 miles at 65 to 85 mph (60 miles one way to work).  My LX is the loaded version, Silver, 5spd man w/traction control and 4 wheel disc brakes, sun roof, premium sound w/4disc cd & cassette.  For the pounding this car has taken, I have more than gotten my $16,425 out of the car.  At 183000 miles I replaced the timing belt (before failure) even though rated at 100k miles, your milaege may vary & it is recommended to do at 100k because of the newer type engines easily damage when the belt goes.",4.875

50, on 03/30/08 12:54 PM (PDT),Str8ShootR ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,As much car as one person needs," I commute 70 miles each day, and this car can make it through an entire week without a refill (auto trans). Bought in '04 at 60K miles; 120K thru '08. Accelerates well enough to get into the flow of traffic on short on-ramps. Decent steering response. The budget sound system has some kick, which is needed at speeds over 35 mph because the cab is quite noisy. CD player is moody with normal discs and dislikes CD- R/RW media. Heater can be a furnace on the coldest of Midwest winter days, but only when the engine is pulling the car at 45+ mph. Surprising roominess on the driver side can accomodate even a larger man, though at the expense of anyone unfortunate enough to be sitting in the back.",4.625
51, on 03/12/08 19:09 PM (PDT),tinytike458 ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,GREAT first car!," I bought this car as a college commuter, and to drive home to work. It had 55,000 miles when bought, and 104,000 miles after it was totalled. I had normal upkeep with this car, never cause a major problem. The driver side door lock wouldn't work from the outside, and no trunk release was annoying. It handled great in the snow belt of Lake Erie, and great on gas. The trunk space was great especially for a constanly moving college student. The stereo system had a great sound. The motor was quiet and it accelerated well. I would reconmend this car to anyone!",5
52, on 08/28/07 07:29 AM (PDT),mk ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Love it!," I got my Neon used in 2004, and have put 80,000 miles on it for a total of 170,000.  I have hit large road debris twice,a huge deer carcass once and a tire carcass another time.  Aside from repairs to the radiator and bumper due to those incidents, I have had no repair needs outside of routine oil changes, new tires, balance and alignment. This car is inexpensive and gets great mileage and costs extremely little to maintain. The manual transmission makes it a fun little car to drive, and it does seat 4 comfortably, with a decent sized trunk.  I love this little car!",5

(rounds per mints...) it can do it pretty well when your on 4000 rpm's and higher. but  thats not an abuse to the motor, but it take lots of power from the engin. other than that its an exelent stock car for the money.

Except for the fact that since it was new, it has always seemed like it has an occasional engine misfire (the dealer replaced the spark plugs and wires under warranty), the car has been great and with over 92,000 miles, the only thing I have needed to do besides normal maintenance (oil changes, etc.) is replace the front brake pads which I did myself for about $25.  The best thing I did was to replace the OEM tires with some 195-60R15 Firestone Indy 500 tires.  What a difference that made in handling!  After the warranty expires, I've been using synthetic oil with 10 - 15000 miles between oil changes, but changing filters at 5,000 miles.",4.25

It now has 113,000 miles! I am pleased with it, considering I only paid $8,500 for it in 2001. When I got it, I had three different people tell me that I made a mistake when I bought it, so I was scared. After 4.5 years, I am pleased. I had an oil leak and replaced a valve cover gasket, cam sensor, and rear seal. It fixed it. That cost around $350-$400 to fix. I have changed the brake pads, spark plugs/wires, air filters and oil changes. This is all I have done to car. Hopefully the car will last me another year or two.",3.625
57, on 07/21/05 12:27 PM (PDT),nimnut ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,Great 1st car," This was my first car and I bought it with 23,000 miles on it. I had to replace the clockswitch within a year, but that was due to a poor repair job the first time. No other major repairs in 4 years after driving about 500 miles back and forth from college to home 4 or 5 times a year. My only complaints: brakes squeak a lot when wet or if not used in a couple of days even when brand new. No trunk latch! It's horrible to have to turn off the car to open the trunk. Paint has been cracked and peeling on the bumper for about 2 years. There is some vibration and noise from the engine that started about a year after purchase. Fabulous, cheap, first car purchase. ",3.875
58, on 06/02/05 11:16 AM (PDT),Jason ,2000 Plymouth Neon Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,Look Elsewhere," Did not have a great experience with this car. Build quality was horrible. The brake pads fell off locking the wheel on way to work. Also had the brakes not work at all (vacuum problem) and almost ended up in the Bay. Lots of rattles, bumper faded (seems to be a usual problem with red Neons). Car feels small, but did have a comfortable seat. With seats down, you could fit quite a bit of stuff. Had a 5 speed manual transmission (automatic was only 3 speed!) which was a bit clunky. The rubberized plastic parts were peeling before I bought it, and only got worse (even with my obsessive car detailing!). ",2.375

Her first car. The car is purple, clean, no rust and the interior looks brand new. Car was taken care of by it's first owner. After getting routine maintenance done on it, it has been a decent lil car. Great gas mileage. She drove it for a year without any problems accept for a minor fender bender in which she had it repaired her self, as well as the usual stuff like oil changes, lower ball joints, control arms, brakes etc. Nothing major has gone wrong with it and still drives and rides pretty good for a 20 year old car. Although sometimes it will stop at idle, but will start right back up. I took it to my mechanic and Dodge Service, replaced sensors and it still stops from time to time, but will start right back up. No one can figure out why it does that. So I just drive. The car has never left us stranded. My daughter bought a 2016 Chevy Cruze and I have been driving The Breeze as a daily driver. I also own a 2015 Chevy SS and by no comparison does The Breeze even come close. But like I said, it's a nice lil car for in town point A to point B trips. Heat and air all work, even the cassette player still works. I tried selling it but most people want to low ball me with $400, $500 dollars, so decided to just keep it and drive it. It will come in handy in the winter as my Chevy SS is RWD. HP is ok for a 4 cyl, nothing to complain about. The Chrysler Cirrus was this car's successor and precursor to Chrysler 200. 10/11/2017 UPDATE: Since my first review I had replaced struts, control arm, end links sway and new tires. Found out why it sometimes stops or cut off in low idle (New computer... $200.00). It's been running pretty good since. Over all I have put about $3000 into this car. Still better than having a car payment imo. Taxes on it are only $29.00 a year and insurance $50.00 a month, so just the usual stuff that goes along with a 20 year old car.",5

One more reason why I don't believe in extended warranties.  But hey, I got this van for free, so why the heck am I complaining?",3.25

There are many things to like about this van:  styling, very comfortable interior, decent fuel economy and overall performance.  However, the transmission suffered a catastrophic failure at 61,000 miles to the tune of $3,000 (this in spite of the fact I am meticulous about all maintainence).  Chrysler was no help at all in this matter. Additionally, the cruise control went south and the front suspension has had numerous parts replaced, but still makes troubling ""clunking"" noises over bumps.  I love the way Chrysler products look and drive.  However, I will warn all people against buying their products because of poor quality control. ",3.75

All of these things were intermittent, so the dealership couldn't nail down the problem. The diagnostics had so many error codes they couldn't figure it out from that either. It got worse over time.

One problem was 2 yrs ago AC compressor blew up - would not have been too expensive except Chrysler was too cheap to install an in-line screen on the ac lines, thus metal exploded into ac lines. My mechanic tried in vain to flush, but ended up replacing compressor, etc. He probably spent 2 weeks - on / off trying to fix - labor was probably 2 grand, but he only charged me 2k w/ all parts & labor.

I'm probably going to have to drop some more cash as the ""service engine soon"" and ""oil light"" are on again. They should make those lights in the shape of dollar signs.

The van ""died"" saving me, as I was protected well and had no life-threatening injuries.

Again, no rebuilds to drivetrain needed.

Now I use it to haul college friends around, and I'm a bit of speed demon.   This thing has been through hell and back. Lady backed out of her driveway and hit the right sliding door. Numerous flat tires, one bent rim, and a frantic drive from Tallahassee to West Palm at an average of about 90 MPH. Never had a major issue.

I have not had any major problems with it. The two biggest problems I have is the A/C won't hold a charge and the turn signals only work sometimes.

It'll cost close to $800 to replace at the dealership and there are indications that the lack of fans working (we don't know how long) has caused damage to the transmission...not sure how much that will cost.  Overall the 3.3L engine has worked great, and we've enjoyed it for long trips.

Within 1000 miles it overheated and cost $1750.00 to fix (oil in radiator); pretty much everything but heads were replaced then a rear main seal. Then the alternator belt snapped and went into main belt and fried compressor. To add to my stupidity I bought a Wynns warranty, which paid next to nothing on all repairs. It is not even good enough to be used as toilet paper. The ASE mechanics that have worked on this are not big fans of any Plymouth, especially late 90s models.

I knew it would need some work even though the previous owner said nothing. The first week, the fan belt came off. Needed a gasket replacement and a new thermostat where the coolant area is (coolant sprayed onto the belt, making the belt slip right off); its the second week and I decided to find out everything that is wrong with it through the dealership. I was told it needs a cam-seal and a valve gasket cover because of two oil leaks (dealership cost $400). My dad and I are going to do the work.

She'sbeen fair on fuel consumption (avg 17mpg mostly short drives of 2-3 miles ata time). Very easy drive, and puts thekids to sleep easily too!",3.75

This van:  replaced master cylinder, battery, one tire.  This all occurred in the second year.  I do think the grands are better quality overall.  This one smelled like a lemon from the start.",3.25

402, on 07/13/10 17:28 PM (PDT),Van to VW ,1997 Plymouth Voyager Minivan 3dr Minivan,Drove her into the ground," I got this van from my parents when it had roughly 140k on it.  I just turned 202k and am only now starting to have problems with it (a variety of things that add up to me getting a new car).  The most I ever put into it was new tires, oil changes, brakes and new joint of some kind (not very car savvy).  It is by no means pretty to look at or not even close to being cool to drive, but it's comfortable and extremely reliable.  I would absolutely buy another one if I had purpose to.  Only getting a Jetta because I have no need for a mini van anymore.  ",4.25

The dashboard is sexy and easy to maneuver around. I had the dealer make a modification to the accessory relay so that my GPS and phone chargers will stay charged when the vehicle is not running. The ride is smooth and with the double-side doors not a single feel of flex or squeak.,5

I have owned since new, have put on 150K with only oil leaks (seals), a starter, a battery and a water pump to go bad. Still has original exhaust. I cannot complain about a single thing on this car. If there was ever a car to just do oil changes, brakes and an occasional timing belt, this is is. I would buy another in a minute.",3.375

406, on 09/08/07 08:09 AM (PDT),nicomp ,1997 Plymouth Voyager Minivan 3dr Minivan,Junky," I bought a '96 Voyager, returned it under the lemon laws less than a year later. Had to pay $1K to lose the '96 and get the '97. At 55K miles check engine light came on. No other symptoms. Dealer couldn't make it go off. Finally they decided to do a valve job. I had to pay $1500 for that. They thought it was a good deal. I guess it was a good deal for them.  Since about 70K miles the engine has been tapping. It sounds like a lifter problem and at 140K miles, it's a constant sound when the engine is running. Sounds like a diesel. Uses oil, burning it and dripping it. Headliner is falling off. Always runs OK, taps constantly. Eats belt tensioners annually. HVAC head has become intermittent.",2.75
407, on 04/08/07 21:43 PM (PDT),Lisa ,1997 Plymouth Voyager Minivan SE 3dr Minivan,No more Chrysler," We bought our Voyager brand new. Virtually everything has been replaced in it. It is ridiculous! Chrysler and other American automakers just cannot compare with foreign automakers which explains the decline in sales. You will be sorry if you buy any Chrysler-made vehicle. The transmission in our Voyager blew at 55,000 and 125,000. Every single American-made vehicle we have bought has had transmission and/or engine issues! Our Toyota Camry has over 200,000 miles on it, and no problems yet! ",1.375
408, on 03/27/07 21:32 PM (PDT),--- ,1997 Plymouth Voyager Minivan SE 3dr Minivan,Buy a Toyota or Honda," Spend the extra couple thousand dollars on a decent minivan/SUV. We have a '97 4-DR SE, and it has been towed 4 times within the last year. We take it to Chrysler to get it maintained on a yearly basis due to the non-reliability, and we also take it to our regular mechanic. Yet, it still croaks. Bought it brand new. Never again. Chrysler needs to clean up their act...and what's the deal with the transmission not being recalled? We baby this minivan, especially with young children. It rides very smoothly one day, and the next, well, we're on the side of the road waiting for a tow truck...has happened 4 times this past year. At least Toyota and Honda stand behind their products.",1.625

Over the years (10) we have had minimal repairs and strictly standard maintenance. I change my own oil and keep an eye on fluid levels. Leaking gasket around oil pan at around 100,000. We are at 120,000 and alas the transmission is slipping. Other than that, a very dependable vehicle.",4.125
410, on 02/18/06 23:40 PM (PST),E ,1997 Plymouth Voyager Minivan SE 3dr Minivan,What a rip-off!," Chrysler could do better making a reliable van. We bought our van in 3/98. It's a '97. Had 13K on it then, now has 126K. It is currently sitting in a parking lot 3 miles from our house because it died when mom was driving it. Hasn't restarted since. Needed a new tranny @ 60K. New engine @ 70K, 4 new air compressors ($1500/each), new clock spring, and God knows what it needs now. Paid $25,000 for it. It's junk. Most expensive vehicle we've bought, but pure junk. Body is in A- condition, mechanical has failed us numerous times. Our mechanic knows us by name because of how many times we've brought it there. Our Japanese cars have definitely outlasted this thing! ",2.125

Initially, we loved the features, the space, the sporty look of the Rallye Model.  Nice, smooth floaty ride.  Nice interior features, great audio system.  Our van now has close to 100K miles.  I feel it has been a decent performer in terms of reliability, yet I know that if I'd had a Honda Odyssey or a Toyota Sienna there would have been fewer trips to our mechanic.  We were SO frustrated when this van was repaired FOUR times for the same belt slipping problem before the problem was solved.  Honda and Toyota would never put an owner through that!",4.25

I have had to have my transmission rebuilt at around 100,000 miles. I am now at 143,000 and the symptoms are returning. I am vigilant at maintaining oil and fluid levels.

Have done all suggested maintenance at intervals recommended by manufacturer, including oil/lube every 3000 miles. Only other work ever done to the van was a new water pump when timing belt was changed @100K+ miles. (And that was preventive, the pump had not failed but all the parts needed to get to it were off so there was no incremental labor costs.)",4.125
