It is beautiful in styling and build quality, very functional, and very cool.  It handles like a dream and has a great exhaust note.  Everyone wants to know what it is and what it cost.",4.75
1, on 08/11/06 19:14 PM (PDT),Panoz  ,2003 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),With a Panoz You Get a Poke in the Nose," My thought when my wife wanted a new Jaguar was that the Jags looked a lot like the Ford Tauras at the time.  I thought that if we bought a sexy very good looking sports car like the Panoz it not only would not look so common but hopfully hold more of its value. I was wrong. The car's style unargueably is very good. They forgot to put any shocks on it though and therefore it is very, very, very rough to drive. The other thing is the convertible roof of the car is is not well designed and it rattles a lot when driving.  The worst part of owning the Panoz is the resale value. There is none. Don't buy one unless you can afford to lose $80,000 really fast.",3.125
2, on 07/15/06 10:43 AM (PDT),jack orbin ,2003 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),Panoz is the absolute best," This is a great car. I have or have had a Mercedes, Jaguar, BMW, Lexus, Triumph and this car beats them hands down in almost every category. My Panoz Esperante is the very best looking car on the road. I love it.",5
3, on 11/24/03 00:00 AM (PST),e1v2a3 ,2003 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),This should be top rated," Just returned from a trip around Florida in less than a week almost 2k miles. I could not belive this car was a hand built sports car made in America.It drew so much attention and rode like a dream.It held lots of luggage and was good on gas, why are these things not on the front page of every magazine in America? I love it.",4.875
4, on 08/02/03 00:00 AM (PDT),Steve Robinson ,2003 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),Panoz Esperante," This is the very best value in exotic sports cars - period.  Construction materials, workmanship, safety, power, handling, comfort, fuel economy and design - this vehicle has it all.  It beats the competition hands down.  There is no close 2nd for value when considering price & performance.  One of the finest designs ever in a thoroughbred sports car.  Made in Americn has returned to all its former glory.",5
5, on 06/14/03 00:00 AM (PDT),Brittney ,2003 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),It's Al Good," The Experience driving on the road was amazing. It rides smooth it drives fast. And it is so comfortable. I felt like I was laying on my Bed but upwards. I havn't drove it that much because it's a very expensive car. I use it for special occasions like going to weddings, taking my kids some where thay want to be recognized!",4.875
6, on 04/17/03 00:00 AM (PDT),Cool Cat ,2003 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),Where do I put the kids?!, My wife and I bought this car before we thought about where we were going to put the kids.  As it turns out we can only fit the two older boys in the trunk comfortably.  Our daughter has to be strapped to the hood.,3

10, on 09/23/04 00:00 AM (PDT),Jeffthefish ,2004 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),"A high-tech, modern throwback ","  The Panoz Esperante recaptures the feeling of the old 289 Cobra, which was always the most exciting streetable ride there was. There's a fun factor so lacking in the other cars available today. Some are faster, most quieter and ride better, some are surely better put together and use prettier materials, but the Panoz gives something else-those intangibles the Cobra gave, the perfect feedback, the complete involvement, the roughness around the edges, the classic style, the exclusivity and the performance that feels better than it actually is. The Esperante, an American made toy, w/high-tech, expensive components that knocks your age back 25-35 years ",5
11, on 07/28/04 00:00 AM (PDT),mobileman ,2004 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),Ferrari drivers give me the thumbs up! , This car gets me more valet attention than any car I have ever had. And I have had over 30 cars!,5
12, on 07/27/04 00:00 AM (PDT),Steve Robinson ,2004 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),Panoz Esperante ," An absolute joy to drive.  Perfect blend of style, comfort, handling and power. American ingenuity at its finest.  A great throwback to European styling with modern practicality and reliability.",5

14, on 02/26/06 05:50 AM (PST),mike ,2005 Panoz Esperante GTLM GTLM 2dr Coupe (4.6L 8cyl S/C 6M),exclusive vehicle," Wow, what a difference! I traded in an '03 panoz classic style for on '05 gtlm coupe that is the super charged ford svt engine. Get the gtlm! It is much faster, the looks are more exotic, plus I love the exclusivity. I love answering questions about the vehicle. At local car shows the people all flock to this car. I can get service at a local ford dealer,plus panoz corporate is great. (no $400 oil changes). The car is a pleasure to drive with easy access and exit. Loads of carbon fiber on the interior and the engine compartment. Leather seats are top of the line and the paint is flawless. I love the coupe gtlm because there are so few of them. the shifting is short and fast. ",5

16, on 01/24/06 12:45 PM (PST),jack ,2005 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),More Rare than a Ferrari or Lambo," More fun than a Corvette, Ferrari, Jaguar XKR, etc, the 2005 Panoz Esperante is fast, comfy, amazingly reliable, sounds great. It is exclusive beyond imagination. No one knows what it is or where it's from. When you say, Hochton, Georgia, they think you're nuts. The engine is so pretty, the hood should be made of glass. The seats are really comfortable and car is not so low that it's hard to get in or out of, like a Corvette.   ",5
17, on 05/23/05 13:30 PM (PDT),Bob ,2005 Panoz Esperante Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.6L 8cyl 5M),Good, Good performance and it has an extremely fast engine with good handling interior could have more space,5
