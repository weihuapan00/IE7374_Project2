0, on 09/18/15 17:54 PM (PDT),Ijustwantavanthatworks ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Worst van we ever owned," Engine blew at 40,000, and now the transmission is slipping in first gear.  There is always some kind of knocking, squeaking, pinging, creaking going on.  The other day my husband and I thought there was a cat meowing under the hood every time we hit a bump, but it was just the van complaining again.  Radio tuner, gas gauge, engine light, ABS light, left side passenger door,  fan, and back wiper work sometimes, not others.   Very loud air conditioner blower.  Have never had a van so loud.   Have had this van in the shop more often than any other vehicle we owned except maybe that Dodge Omni we bought in college.   We will never buy another Saturn!",2
1, on 08/03/10 12:33 PM (PDT),cbt ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Piece of crap," MOST RECENT problem: from being PARKED with engine running, car slid into REVERSE, rolled downhill, knocked me over twice and hit my neighbor's tree (better than the house)!  Add to that problems we've had since we bought it new: both sliding doors sometimes won't close; the dash lights flicker; the a/c goes out and we have to move the knob to heat and back to get cool air again; a/c only blows cool when we're actually rolling; ""ABS disengaged"" light comes on all the time; full brake replacement at 50K miles; radio changes station when braking suddenly; dead spot in accelerating from a stop; gas reads empty on incline even when 1/4 full; back wiper doesn't move; hard to get into 3rd row.",1.75
2, on 04/20/10 18:02 PM (PDT),Daddyainthappy ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Yugo's were better.," Not really but not far off. I had this thing in the shop four times while it was under warranty for an annoying popping/clicking noise in the front end. Each time they said they had it fixed and alas, it is now out of warranty and still pops.Oh, and the service engine light came on about 2000 miles after warranty expired. The computer code shows the catalytic converter is not functioning properly. Now my transmission is slipping horribly. Fluid is clean and has always been full. This van has not been driven hard or fast. It is simply a lemon and from looking at the other reviews, it is not alone in it's misery.",3.125
3, on 01/19/10 19:54 PM (PST),LEW ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),I loved this van," This was the best van I ever owened.  I had one problem with one of the doors, it wouldnt close sometimes.  The gas mileage wasnt to good but other than that the kids and I loved it.",4.625
4, on 08/06/09 05:08 AM (PDT),noHappyRelayOwner ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),ABS/Trac Control Light....AGAIN!!!!," We have had our vehicle in the shop 5 times now for the ABS Trac light issue. Everytime, ""I think we got it this time, must have been a short"", or ""Faulty wiring, we replaced it"". It just seems funny that this issue happened right at the time the warranty went out. ",2.75
5, on 01/22/09 04:42 AM (PST),gr8joy75 ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Not 100% happy," Like many others, our Relay has been in for repairs numerous times.  From the beginning it doesn't want to start at times.  Now that warranty is expired they found problem. Imagine that!  We don't have the problem with the molding like others, but it has been in for the brakes, sway bar, rear upper light, back seat pull broke, air vent broke (all plastic on it is cheap) shortly after purchase. Gets better gas mileage than others reported, but we set cruise at 65mph. Hwy mpg is about 28-30. Seats are difficult to get out.  Otherwise, it's a good vehicle.  ",3.5
6, on 06/01/08 21:03 PM (PDT),tee ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Not so happy ," We have owned our Saturn for 9 months now and are not satisfied. We have been in and out of the dealership with so many problems : electrical ( abs and traction tire system needed to be serviced every other 3 weeks)  front tires squeal like a 50 year old car. The darn car beeps at you for no reason while driving down the road. The engine light goes on and off and dealership can't find a problem. Lost cruise control while driving on freeway, just cruising along and bang lost speed no warning just shut itself off. So not happy wish we could get rid of it.",4.25
7, on 04/22/08 11:35 AM (PDT),sgtuglee ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Always Reliable," My 4th Saturn, I pulled a 3000 pound trailer from MD to AK via FL and AZ. Driven in 117 degree AZ and -23 degree AK. Always starts always works. Handles 12"" fresh snow with no problem.  Goes on ice, but doesn't like to stop or change direction, so go slow. Kids love the interior. Used the OnStar phone when we couldn't get cell signal in back country. I got 12 MPG towing 3000 lbs. I get 23 on mountain highway with no trailer and light load. 16 mpg in town. 14 mpg in snow in town. Continental tires were lousy. Have michelins now and they seem to be lasting well. Have had only one dealer needed repair and they covered it for free even though the warranty had expired by 2k miles. ",4.625
8, on 04/17/08 18:50 PM (PDT),Julie ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Do NOT Purchase this vehicle," I have had this van for almost 2 years now and it currently is in the shop for the 5th time. The driver door is always broken and you cannot drive the van with less than a half a tank of gas on an incline - the fuel cannot get to the engine and the car dies or will not start if parked.   I've had a rental for over a week and was just given a document from gm stating they couldn't fix the problem - it's ""just the way the car was designed"" and that I would have to live with it.  Very unreliable, interior plastic is cheap and breaks, the brakes squeal constantly, I had to replace tires at 15k.  Horrible gas mileage - about 15 mpg!",1.75

Tires replaced, extensive investigation of rough ride, dealership states ""interent to the vehicle"".  I will never buy another saturn. Only started happening about 15,000 miles.",2.125
10, on 07/18/07 02:06 AM (PDT),TTC ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),"Few problems, but great buy"," Excellent experience with this, my first Saturn. It handles well, convenient features (cargo trays, sliidng doors, DVD.  Mileage 16 city, 24 hwy. No fit or finish problems. Only problems were flickering lights (fixed by dealer) and a radio that refuses to get any AM station (all FM stations are perfect!).",3.5
11, on 06/28/07 12:08 PM (PDT),rob ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Not so happy," I have owned my Relay for two years now, and it has seen its fair share of shop time. The steering pump has been replaced once and they have put tow steering columns and a new set of tie rods. The gas mileage isnt near what I expected either, it is worse. The kids do love the dvd player though and it looks sharp for a mini van.",2.75
12, on 04/02/07 17:18 PM (PDT),BP ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Domestics are still great, This was a much better deal than Toyota or Honda and looks far better than either. We will likely buy Saturn again if they keep making this van.,4.875
13, on 03/24/07 05:39 AM (PDT),Evets ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),The good and not so good," We wanted a van and chose a Saturn based on the design and performance of the 3 Saturns we owned previously. While we really like the interior design and economy (avg 26 hwy) it seems this may have been rushed to market without adequate testing. There is a howl that eminates from the windshield at highway speed that can't be resolved, moulding and interior trim have simply fallen off, the automatic door won't close for no apparent reason(not good in a Michigan winter), there seem to be random rough idle issues.  No breakdowns but just not the level of quality we had experienced previously and come to expect. We won't buy GM again.",4.25
14, on 02/01/07 07:43 AM (PST),Dave ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),2006 Saturn Relay, Nice vehicle but has an incurable electrical problem. Lights flicker so much that oncoming cars flash their lights. Saturn dealership tried replacing alternator but this did not help.  Dealership's ultimate finding was that this model just has this quirk and there is nothing they can do about it. Automatic side doors malfunctioning. Side doors had to be disabled after opening and closing repeatedly with alarm beeping continuously.,3
15, on 11/22/06 18:10 PM (PST),Evets ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),2006 Relay on the road," This is our fourth Saturn vehicle.  We had 2 sport coupes and a 4 door and needed a van.  Purchased as a good overall value, we got this van with 1,500 miles for what we would have paid for the ""leading minivan"" with 70k miles.  It rides and performs well and gets good mileage for a vehicle its size.  Here about 1 year and 30k later we have some minor fit and finish issues.  It's fairly loud at highway speed, there's an annoying windshield howl at 70mph, experienced by a fellow Relay owner as well, some weatherstrip is already coming loose and I have had a minor transmission slip.  Hopefully it will hold up a bit better over the long haul.  Like the design, just seems the assembly is sloppy.",4.25
16, on 10/11/06 16:07 PM (PDT),bselmon ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Love it after 1 year," We have had our Relay for 1 year, The dealership warranty replaced a door motor and a radio , no questions asked. People remark how comfortable the 2nd row captain's seats are.  I like the pickup and the rear ultrasonic sensors, great for tight parking spots.  The kids love the DVD.  We love the car and have been treated well",4.5
17, on 08/17/06 21:59 PM (PDT),SpanglishScienceMom ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),What Relay did I Buy??," Wow! After reading all these great reviews, I'm wondering if we are talking about the same vehicle. The mpg has never been over 16.8, and that's w/all freeway driving.  In the summer during the hotest days of Aug, the A/C refused to work twice. When usung the A/C mpg tops out at 15.1. Lots of minor molding, door sticking, cup holder derailing issues. Met other Saturn owner at dealership w/ identical issues plus they suffered oil leaks that were not satisfactorily handled. I miss my '91 4-Runner!",3.375
18, on 07/24/06 09:52 AM (PDT),Mad Matt ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Very Satisfied with Relay.," I tested most minivans before purchasing the Relay.  Great braking and handling.  Confortable for long trips.  I bought with heavy incentives from GM, and I like it more that the Honda and Hyundai.  I paid 7k less than most of the competition and it is a better minivan.  Can't beat that.",5
19, on 07/04/06 08:48 AM (PDT),Bryan ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Could be better," Our Relay has been a vehicle that our children have come to love with the built in DVD player.  We couldn't go anywhere without it.  It is a smooth ride with a few bugs that need to be worked out.  The molding has a problem with sticking to the vehicle.  Our tires (Continentals) were worn to the wires after 11,000 miles.  The automatic sliding passenger door pops when closing.  Other than that we really like the vehicle.  OnStar is not the best thing if you dont live in the city.  Have tried using it when things go wrong with the vehicle and they cannot get the contracted towing companies to come out to give us a tow.  The first year service is ok for free but we would not pay for OnStar.",4.625
20, on 05/27/06 04:05 AM (PDT),Lady Anne ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Saturn 2006 Relay 3," The Relay 3 was the perfect minivan for us. As a disabled veteran a wheelchair, so we needed something with a lot of room but did not want a full sized van. The interior is very roomy, it comes standard with a DVD player and a 120 outlet in the back. Ours had the entertainment package & came with 2 wireless headphones as well. The center & backrow seats and toy box, lift out very easily, and there is tons of storage. Driving the Relay has been refreshing as well. It handles extremely well and has fantastic pickup. I highly recommend the Relay to everyone looking for an affordable minivan with lots of room, tons of standard features, and is fun to drive. ",5
21, on 12/17/05 23:49 PM (PST),Joe ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Great, I have found that the Relay is a great vehicle to drive and the gas mileage on our Relay has been fantastic. The included DVD player has been a lifesaver. I also love the electrical outlet that allows you to plug in regular electric products like a PS 2 game system.  ,5

23, on 10/25/05 22:13 PM (PDT),Barbara ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),"Fun Family Car, Lots of Small Problems"," Bought Nov 2004, I love to go for drives with the family in my Relay.  I don't like that GM does not support all the issues it has had.  And the recall that made the second row seats difficult to flip forward has made getting to the third row inconvenient.  ",4
24, on 10/18/05 20:29 PM (PDT),Debra ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Great so far...," So far we love our Relay - The sliding door had to be recallibrated and the pinstriping is peeling - but these are minor things that can be fixed...  as far as Mini Vans go - It is easy to handle and fun to drive - Our son has plenty of room in the second row loves the DVD!  We only hope it gives us the same satifaction our first Saturn did which is still kicking after over 120,000 miles.",4.625

27, on 08/27/05 09:15 AM (PDT),Ruth ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Not overly impressed," I went against one of my basic rules and bought a first year model vehicle. GM continues to use inferior materials and parts. The brake pads wore out after only 8,000 miles and some exterior molding came loose soon after purchase. It handles well and has ok perfomance,but a couple of little details drag it down.",3.125

30, on 07/29/05 14:19 PM (PDT),Scott Nelson ,2006 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Mixed blessing," Our Saturn Relay has been a great vehicle to drive and carry the crew around in.  Good acceleration and handling for a large vehicle.  The trim needs a lot of work!  Exterior trim is peeling off, door trim and plastic mouldings behind the sliding doors peel off when the door opens.  Interior trim around both front doors is broken, and fell off, what a pain.

31, on 12/28/06 12:22 PM (PST),pdg ,2007 Saturn Relay Minivan 2 4dr Minivan (3.9L 6cyl 4A),Saturn Relay, This is by far the roomiest and best handling minivan I have owned.  I've owned a Toyota Sienna and Nissan Quest in the past. The price was much less than that of other makes but had more options and standard features.  I would definitely recommend this minivan.,4.75
32, on 06/21/17 22:45 PM (PDT),Zachary ,2005 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 AWD 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),2005 Saturn RElay AWD Don't go near one of these," This is the worse van on the market. GM designed this in 2005????? It reminds me of a mid 1990's Chyrsler. It's heavy, seats weigh a ton, under powered -- it's a dog with the 3.5 slow.... Forgrt about the power doors - pull fuse 21, or your batterey will drain every 2 days. The air Conditioning is terrible - with a full charge. My instrument panel looks like Christmas - abs warning - gas cap warning - service light is on - Too much to list . Oh, the gas mileage - 15 mpg overall - take out all the seats - I swear they weigh a 100 pounds each - and you  will average 16 mpg. DO NOT BY A RELAY< UPLANDER< MOUNTAINER< OR THE BUICK version. I really believe GM stoped caring and went so cheap with this one. Seats wear and crack after the first year. Gm is doing well now - maybe 2008 - they almost lost the ship - woke them up.",1

They have opened while driving 75mph down the highway and GM is refusing to fix them even though we have a 16 page detailed service report of these on going problems.  Put the doors aside and the other issues we have had with this very expensive vehicle and it is a great ride.  It is a very comfortable and smooth ride.  But I will never buy another GM vehicle again, we were sold a lemon of a vehicle and GM just tells us too bad.  Hopefully not everyone is having the same problems we are.  But I would not recommend buying this vehicle to anyone.  The dvd screen is way too small for the kids to see it good from in back.",3

I enjoy driving it and it is very reliable the only time it never started was when i left the radio on (my mistake). Had to replace the hub and bearing at 75,000. It does have trouble with stalling my mechanic told me what the problem was something with the electric fuel something with aftermarket part still on the expensive side but if you give it a little gas when you start it. Yes i know it's not ideal but for what i paid for it. I guess i got one of the good ones. Look, it's not a Lincoln or Mercedes you do get what you pay for stop complaining and get a more expensive car if you want perfection.",4.25

Excellent van that does everything right, everything is still in perfect working order and exterior and interior still looks brand new with no inside garaging. This is my 5th Saturn vehicle and I have had no problems with any of them and I have had all models. Love this car. Stuck in a southern California blizzard once and this car was the only one able to negotiate the freeway safely and did so well I felt like I was driving under normal conditions. Also, really liked the buying experience with Saturn and all the service experiences. This car was very stress free to own",4.875
39, on 04/24/10 20:25 PM (PDT),Love my Relay ,2005 Saturn Relay Minivan 3 AWD 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Happy with my Relay," We purchased our Saturn with only 11000 miles on it from the dealer.  It has a smooth ride and is very comfortable.  My 4 kids have loved the dvd player and the option to listen to their music and play video games.  It comes with a normal plug outlet, very cool! This has come in handy for video games and for vacuming the van.  The only problems I have had with the Relay is with the traction stability control system (had it fixed 2X now) and I feel the rotors are cheap.  My Relay shakes going down the mountain roads. I was told they have shaved the rotors as much as they can so they will need to be replaced at my next brake job.",4.5

Yes the interior is nice but the ABS and stablization controls are always broken. Sliding doors will randomly open - or they may not open at all - it's a gamble. Have to press the gas to get it started - engine has a hard time turning over. Lights flicker. Saturn will tell you this is ""normal"" -  but it's still not acceptable. They should all be recalled and demolished.",2.875

The van came with a warranty and took it to a dealership to be fixed and was told that it was the fuel pump. The replaced the fuel pump and now it is still having the same problem.

It was in the shop 2 days after purchase for a auto sliding door malfunction. The headlights have malfunctioned in the middle of the night on a car trip out of state. We were stranded until daylight until we could drive it to the nearest dealership, and it took them a week to fix it!!! Worst of all are the breaks. The brakes malfunction from time to time, and the ABS light comes on. I've had it in the dealership's shop 8 times just for this problem, and they won't fix it!

Car has been up and down the east coast. First long distance trip went from DE to CT and back on 3/4 of tank...impressive. As the years and miles went by notice problems.

But this is not a Saturn (and Saturn isn't the company it used to be) it is a piece of junk.  Constantly in the shop. Over heats going uphills (even with the heater on full blast)Brakes unreliable, smoke going down hill even in 2nd gear, sometimes brakes don't take when coming to stop signs. Finally got the ABS light fixed $2000 later. Passenger door still doesn't close right. Makes grinding noise sometimes when starts, sometimes doesn't start at all. NOT SAFE. I wish I had never bought it.  Still owe between $5000 and $10000 more than it's worth on it. Anyone heard of any class action suits with/about it yet?",1.75

The outside is designed to look more like a SUV than a minivan.  It is very roomy inside and I like to two captains chairs. We paid $27,500 for a Relay 3 , loaded. It handles great.  The kids love the DVD.  I love the rear ultrasonic sensors and my paralell parking has improved.  The OnStar is pretty cool.  ",4.25

That is what attracted us to this vehicle. Knowing that our family was in desperate need to replace our '02 Ford Taurus with a vehicle that would accomodate our children's active lifestyle, the Relay was the answer. Saturn's low key sales approach and excellent service reputation made this decision even easier. So far (only 7k mile)the family loves it, although I find the seats on the small side, I'm 6ft 220lbs. No mechanical problems and the engine is very responsive. It was a good purchase.  ",4.125

It has plenty of room and standard features that won't break your pocketbook.  The OnStar feature is helpful, and the drive is exceptional. Get the convienance package as it will help out with long trips and entry/exit for the vehicle.  Also, if you want more room, get a FWD 2 instead of a FWD 3. The captain's chairs on the second row take up a lot of room. If you get the bucket seats for the second row, you will have plenty of room to spare, and it is very comfortable to sit in; even for an adult.  The drive is nice and the  ammeneties are all that we need.  Very nice vehicle.  ",4.875

Plenty of storage room behind the rear seat, lots of leg room, AND a decent place for a purse!  (Hard to find in any vehicle!) It's easy to drive and very comfortable.  Our kids call it the SUVan because of the exterior look-- they like that is doesn't look like all the other minivans on the road.  Highly recommend!  ",5

Again, Saturn has proven - they know what they are doing.  We were skeptical in purchasing a minivan, but the 'SUV' look & Minivan comfort did it for us.  Affordable, dependable and we get tons of compliments.  Get the Automatic door & DVD Player - it is worth it for the little ones.  Great use of space front to back; comfortable seats all around.  For those 'anti-minivan folks' - this is a good choice.  Adults & kids alike have a great ride whether 15 mins or 5 hours.  We are really pleased with our RELAY.  ",4.875

It is an elegant looking car, we got lots of stares.  My son loves the built- in DVD player; we enjoy being able to fold down the seats at night time for the kids to sleep, and make all normal for seven people during the day.

Easy to see out of and fairly comfortable (I'm 6' 210 pounds). The car is not fast in my opinion but I guess it depends on what you are used to. The car is very simple which is good and I think this body style will hold up well over time. I have read where people say that putting the top up and down is difficult. I have to wonder how these people function in life as this top operation could not be easier. So far I have replaced both VVT solenoids which is par for the course on a GM.

I would know since I've wanted one the day they came out. That was in middle school. I saved and saved and finally bought a very nice condition Sky Redline. Looks immaculate. Being a college student I took the safe road and purchased a sports car with realiability to back it (according to numerous reviews). WRONG! At least in my case. This car has been in the shop longer than its been in my driveway (unless we count the time it isn't running). The Chevy dealer I bought it from cannot locate the issue. It stalls, the fan stops working occasionally, my blinkers don't work when they want to...it's an electrical problem.  DO NOT do what I did and automatically figure it's a sound car...test drive it multiple times, have it inspected and be skeptical. Obviously my car is the one in a million with severe problems  (and none of which documented in multiple different VIN history reports) but just be aware so you don't end up like I did. I kmow these cars are great cars...mine just happens to be junk! I don't want this to happen to anyone else. When I read reviews I never once saw a post like this...it gave me a strong sense of security. I just want possible buyers to realize its possible for these cars to be junk. I'm not sure what the previous owner (there was only one) did to this vehicle but it must have been pretty bad. Unfortunately they knew how to upkeep appearance and make a wolf in sheep's clothing and I got the short end of the stick.",2

I love the car and the only bad points are lack of storage space and ease of entry and exit, that's it.  Good points, styling, handling, ride, yes ride it rides better than my 2004 Acura TL, ask my brother.  Reliability, well don't have enough miles to judge that just yet but my first Sky only had a small differential leak recall (mine was not leaking but repaired under warranty) that's it.

One problem I have a rattle in the dash area that no one can seem to correct and it's driving me crazy.

After a year and half on the road, I still get shouts of ""nice car"" or thumbs up from pedestrians and drivers alike.  Like any roadster, it does have its blemishes here and there.

My 64 Vette 327-365 HP 4 speed is a fun ride but my 73 year old left leg is getting weak. The automatic in the Sky is plenty fast and the old leg is quite comfortable. Top up or down this little baby is as fun to drive as my other baby a 1949 MG TC which is a 4 speed. To complete my passion for neat cars I have a 2002 Trans Am convertible with an automatic just as a backup. The Sky is a perfect runabout vehicle and the future is here. Side mirrors are questionable and the lack of a decent console storage box is apparent but I'll just get used to it. Great car Saturn and it really draws looks from the Solstice ,4.5

The car is a constant hit with everyone you meet. I love the XM radio and all the small speakers. Even with the top down at 80 sounds are still clear and strong.

Worth the wait. An 08 with 44,500 so there were a few issues. Front tires, alignment etc. To be expected but again, well worth it. This car is so much fun to drive. I feel almost like its part of me when I drive. No turbo, just the bass but plenty fast and quick. I'm not a speedster but it is a mover and handles absolutely wonderful. Very responsive and will go where you point it, right now. Hugs the road like glue however the tires can and do break loose at a wet intersection with too much pedal in a 90° turn. Just lite in the rear. The only cons I have come up against is, being 6"" and 230 a couple more inches of  legroom and an inch more headroom would be nice but its not uncomfortable. The looks of the car is beyond killer. I get looks, and ""Wow! What is that?"" Or ""Nice car"" a lot. More than any other car I have owned. They only made like 35,000 Sky's so if you want fun in your driving, turn heads and have something VERY few people have (but many wish they did) and have a Permagrin, Saturn Sky, baby!

Buy one.," I owned one, drove it for 25,000 miles, sold it for some extra cash to put down on a house. Already looking for another one. You can go pay twice as much for an S2000 or go ahead and get an underpowered Miata but what's the point? A Sky Redline with a $300 Trifecta Tune is easily the best performance car you can get for your money. Less than 3,000lbs, near perfect 50/50 weight distribution and over 300hp/350lbs of torque (With the previously mentioned tune) will put you into C6 Corvette range while getting close to 30MPG. Not to mention cheap insurance costs, easy and inexpensive to maintain (the 2.0 turbo motor is still being thrown into most current GM models today, parts are everywhere, stop crying about Saturn being dead). The top takes literally 4 seconds to put down, I don't understand why people complain about it so much. The interior could be slightly better quality (less plastic) but it looks good and honestly, you'll have so much fun driving it you wont care. The trunk space isn't great, but if that really mattered you wouldn't be looking at a roadster right now anyway. There are luggage racks you can mount on the trunk (temporarily) for longer trips which work just fine. Honestly though, my favorite part about the car is that you rarely see them anywhere. I cant go anywhere in summer without seeing a Corvette, Miata, S2000 or a Z3 anymore but seeing another Sky is like seeing a unicorn. People always stop and ask me what I'm driving and it's extremely entertaining to watch their reaction when I told them it's a Saturn. So, in conclusion, the only realistic flaws among an extremely long list of positives are: No trunk space. And a Saturn badge. Both have very simple solutions. Now go buy one. And start picking on some Mustangs. They don't like being humiliated by Saturns (When they aren't busy running into crowds of people).",5

It's noisy at high speed, and when you really get down on it the acceleration should be smoother.  The dash developed a couple of different rattles after a year.

It looks really cool, but that's about it. It's broken down already. I never had a turbocharger before and I'll probably never buy one again. It seems like it makes it more prone to breaking or maybe it's just because it's a GM. I love the way it looks, but it's not that fast considering its power rating and turbo.

Fantastic car. Turns heads like crazy. No one knows what it is. Especially those younger than 25. Took it to dealer for inspection. They could not believe this car. They all went crazy over it. They did 5 outstanding recalls. No charge. Guess I'll keep it. It will somsday be a classic. They only made like 32,000. You know better than have are gone ant those with ultra low mileage are even rarer. So if you want a nice sport car. Thesevwould be what you want. I also have a 2000 vette conv.

The Sky is definitely not for snow travel. It will slide in only a skift of snow and leave you stranded.   We started out this season and noticed that the airbag warning came on.  We only had 40,000 miles on the Sky when this occurred.  We took it to the  dealership after reading many bad reviews about the airbag performance particularly on that side.  Imagine our disappointment when the dealer informed us that this had not been recalled as of yet. We took it to the dealership and the bill was $939.00.  I talked to a friend who has the Pontiac version of this car and the same thing has happened to theirs. There has to be a flaw and/or defect in that system.  There are multiple fixes on You-Tube about this.  I don't see how unplugging the indicator life is a fix, some people did...but we opted to fix ours so that if we are involved in a crash the passenger has protection.

Well, it was a hard decision, but the idea of putting MORE money into the Sky was not what I wanted to do right now. I needed more room too.

It was fun to drive, but not very reliable.  The Sky reminds me of the way the MG handled, but it has more power and is more comfortable.  The MG had clips on the right and left for the top and it was a pain to take down.  I've read some complaints that the top on the Sky is difficult to take down, but it takes about 15 seconds to take down and about 20 to put back up.  It is well designed for a mechanical top.   This car has plenty of power and is so much fun to drive.  I love putting the top down and taking it on a curvy road and listening to the engine roar.

These things are built well for the most part.

It handles like it's on rails, has a nice solid feel, decent power for a NA engine (I plan on putting a big turbo on it in a few years).  With the sub it's stereo has an excellent sound.

Check the trip mileage, oil life and remaining miles on your gas fight on the steering wheel as well as cruise and radio controls. Climate control, just as easy.

In my opinion the most beautiful car on the roads today.  While consumer mags complain about the lack of trunk space, mechanicaly operated top, and poorly placed window and seat controls, they fail to mention that this is a roadster not a minivan. They sell those in the same lot by the way, at about the same price. After 13,000 miles I have adjusted to all of it's so called ""flaws"". Of course, if you still want to put the top up with a touch of a button, SLKs are only $25000 more, of course, they don't look as good as a Sky, but then again, what does?",4.5

I love the way the car handles and looks.  However, I do have some complaints about the interior design. There is a cup holder on the right side of the console that constantly opens whenever I have a passenger in the car. Also, the buttons for the windows are in a very awkward area and hard to reach with your left hand.  It's also hard to reach the seatbelts.  The gas gauge is very small and hard to read.  Also, not very ""sound proof"" when the top and windows are up. Gas tank takes up all the room in small trunk. It's not a car for taking a trip in for two. But I love my Sky!  I've waited a long time for it.",4.75

It handles amazingly well, even if it is slightly underpowered for a sportscar enthusiast.  The Redline version has more horsepower and better fuel economy, so there's little reason not to get one instead.

The top is easy to put up and take down contrary to some reports. This is my first convertible, and I expected much more wind noise with the top up, and was pleasantly suprised it was quieter than I'd expected. Handling is excellent, and mileage is respectable for what it is, a convertable roadster. Anyone who doesn't like this car either has kids or dogs, or needs/wants too much stuff around them at all times. This car wasn't intended for the masses. Space for two is all I need.

Unfortunately my happiness just went downhill from there. Quality and craftsmanship is very poor. I've been to the dealership about 8 times already, and here is a list of problems so far. Roof leaked, needed sealant in the front end of the top. Poor quality paint job, could see primer at some spots. Driveline noise, rear axle leakage. AC compressor noise and malfunctioning when engaged. This is only after 4 months and 7000 miles later. I still love the car, but it's very embarrassing to have this many problems with a brand new vehicle like that. I gotta say I'm very disappointed. ",2.875

I stand there looking at it (like everyone else) and shake my head saying, ""I can't believe this is a GM product.""  Saturn hit this one out of the ballpark and with minor exceptions, is the best value of any sports car on the market.  In other words, this car looks like a $50-70,000 sports car.  That's what people say, that's what they think, and I'm embarrassed to tell them how much it really cost.  In fact, from now on, I'll just go along.

I told him that it was a good looking car, ""it is beautiful and the best looking car I have ever seen.""   It has good performance and is quite tight with the the width of the tires and the additional steering capabilities.  You would never realize a 4 cylinder engine could provide so much power.

280, on 03/15/16 10:35 AM (PDT),doc4bax ,2006 Saturn ION Sedan 2 4dr Sedan (2.2L 4cyl 5M),Saturn = Chevy = Junk," I used to have a older Saturn and it held up well. I figured I would find one for my son to drive back and forth to school. I found one, bought it and it had a host of issues. This vehicle is notorious for front end suspension failure. First to go are the front sway bar end links and the sway bar bushings. They are poorly made and wear out prematurely. You hear that clunking noise going over bumps? If so you have this problem. Another problem is the front control arm bushings which are known for failure. Another clunking noise under your feet? You might want to take a look. Another issue, the plastic fuel tank is known to crack at the top where the plastic lines enter the fuel pump (which is in the fuel tank). That wiff of fuel you smell at the back of the vehicle? That means get your wallet out. Fortunately for me, there was a special warranty that I qualified for and GM took care of it. I just made it under the time length (expires 8 years from manufacture date). This is not a cheap fix. They had to replace the tank, fuel pump and hoses plus labor. Also, their is a problem with the shifter. The shifter looses the ability to talk to the ignition switch.  When you put the car in park the key will not release from the ignition switch. This leaves the  ignition stuck in the accessory position and drains your battery if left there. Fortunately this was covered under recall and it wasn't a cheap fix. Another recall is the actual ignition switch which I had done. the rear shocks wear out prematurely. This car bounced like a clone car when I first got it.  This a $50 fix if you do it yourself. Lastly, the electric actuator that recirculates the air from inside or outside the vehicle goes bad. The gears shear off that turn the recirculation door. This actuator is located way up inside the dash.  Dealer estimates around $600 plus to replace it as the dash has to completely come off to get to it. I was able to do this myself with minimal dash removal but it was an absolute nightmare and took all day to do. Relatively cheap part but a lot in labor costs to install.",3

I've owned probably 20 cars in my life and never seen a company ignore a known severe problem (the ignition switch failure) leaving consumers to pay $700 or more to have repair work done.  I marvel at the prior reviews - people posting here after they bought their Saturn's.  The fact is after a few years (we now have 45000 miles on our car) the thing begins to fall apart.  Windows falling off, ignition won't turn off, bearings failing, it's a real piece of you know what.  I understand things fail but what is irritating is that known severe failures should cause the company to recall or reimburse.",3.25

My Ion is very reliable, but only with some fixing of things I've NEVER had to fix on any car before, even when it was 10 years old.  Ions are notorious for bad ignition switches. When you turn the key....nothing happens, not even a click of the starter. I've replaced sway bar links, insulator and bushings.  The catalytic converter is partially blocked up. My gearshifter was replaced in the first year for chrome chipping off the top. The current one needed the top superglued back on. ",3.875

The quality of the ION 3 is much poorer than with the SL.  It's obvious that Saturn cut corners with the ION, which may account for its short run.  Like others, I've noticed that the interior seems cheaply made, and the material does easily stain.  The biggest problem is that the car keeps surging when I'm idling at a stop sign or a red light.  I've taken it to the dealer multiple times, and they can't find anything.  I was originally very proud to own a Saturn since the company took a lot of pride in its products, but the company obviously doesn't care about quality like it once did.",3.25

The ION rides as if it was heavier than it really is. Changing the oil is a breeze when compared to my previous automobile.

In my husband's line of work, he's been in 2 accidents not his fault already being on the road so much. One was a side- swipe that didn't damage anything, another was a rear-ending that was inexpensive to fix the back bumper. We've also taken it on several trips from San Antonio to El Paso (550 miles) and it does fantastic. The gas mileage is great. With the old trade-in and down payment, we're paying less than $300 a month. The car is stylish, drives like a 6 cylinder,",5

Only took an hour and I was out the door - great service.  And the car, it is a gem.  The car has OnStar, drives well - completely quit.  And the power is more than my Nissan Sentra SE-R.

Only a few cosmetic blemishes (crack in upper front fender, small hole in side of drivers seat, but ran strong.  Over the next 15 months, have replaced; A/C Unit (bought car in winter, was unable to test, Compressor was broken, replaced under warranty), new rear shocks ($50 from RA, did myself), upgraded front brakes (drilled and slotted units from RA for $105, did myself), new front wheel bearings ($75 total from RA, did myself) lower control arms ($105 total from RA, again, did myself).  Not all cars are perfect, but this one has been the most fun to drive since my 1978 Firebird I had in 1982. It has the gumption to get up and go on the highway AND, you can do the Supercharger upgrade from the Redline OR Cobal SS without doing anything special as the 2.2 will handle the extra power without strengthening the valve train or crankshaft.

After spending towing fees and replace the ignition, I found out that it might have been caused by parking it too long with the wheels turned hard left. (I know, I know - sounds goofy, but now I always make sure the wheels are perfectly in line when I park.) anyway, it does get good gas mileage (I have a long commute), it is ok comfort wise for a car of its class.

The 5 speed shifts smooth and fast. It tells you when to shift too! I got the base model for $13,500. The dashboard is a clever design. Took one day to get used too! I have test driven just about every car in this price range and this car has the best pick up for the price. The 2.2l engine is amazing! The interior is very roomy. Seats are comfy but could use a little more comfortable seats! But for this price can't really ask for a lot! Another downside when you have passengers is either your legs get squished or theirs if your seat is slid all the way back! There's less then 8"" of legroom for the passengers.",5

The overall design is pretty good.  Rear visability is kinda poor but you work around it. At first I didn't like the gauges in the middle but now it has grown on me.  You can actually see them better then on the left side.  I heard Saturn might get rid of the plastic panels next year because of the gap that is needed because it expands.  I personally like the dent free sides.  i wasn't looking to buy a new car any time soon but decided I wanted something good on gas and this is my choice.  Coming from Jeeps and pickups I am very pleased so far.,4.625

Gas mileage is excellent, and amazingly efficient if you can keep your highway driving under 2500 revs (about 60mph).  Most of what has been mentioned in other reviews is accurate, except for those calling the car a lemon.  I haven't had any problems with the service departments.

The revised engine, same as Cobalt, plus leather interior plus XM radio/CD/sunroof makes this Saturn a fun car. Revisons to struts and sway bars make for a nice firm and controlled ride - compared to ION 2. Leather is better than I expected - about as good as my old 2001.5 Passat GLX. Fit and finish quite good. No problems as delivered. Very good low end torque when compared with 2.2L engine. And the ""deal"" was very good - well below sticker plus $1,250 in rebates.

The car isn't as well built or as easy to drive as a SL2, gas mileage is horrible. Seats aren't comfortable after about 30 min of driving. I doubt that a 6th Saturn will be in our future.

The Ion 3 with the 170hp, 2.4L engine in my opinion compares to the Mazda6.  There are no dealer games and they got me awesome GMAC financing.  This is the first time I feel like I got an absolute steal on a car purchase.  The only thing that needed getting used to was the console that is in the center of the dashboard.

The steering was awesome and precise but with all front wheel drive cars, you have torque steer, and this car had some torque.

I owned mine for a total of two weeks and its entire axel fell out of the bottom. Not to mention on my third year of ownership the entire thing was basically a dry rotted shell of a car. The whole thing is a complete disaster from the tasteless turn of the century decorum to the engine that consumes more gas than a Boeing 737. I took my mother to her doctors appointment a couple weeks back and when we went to leave the office I cranked the car and the check engine light was on. We made it about a mile down the road when the vehicle began over heating. I pulled off and began calling my brother to pick us up when flames and profuse smoke started coming from the engine. Thankfully we were able to extinguish the fire in time, however the car alarm feature was damaged and the alarm sounded until we could have the vehicle towed in to the garage. This car is a death trap on wheels and ages worse than a straw hut in the middle of a tropical rain forrest. Do not buy!!!!!",1

I previously drove '93 and '99 Saturn SC2 coupes and had no major problems. I kept my Ion much longer than my other 2 Saturns for various reasons. I was sorry that GM discontinued the Saturn line in 2009; the brand had high customer loyalty. If the Saturn brand hadn't been closed, I'd have bought another one. After 11 years and 126K miles, my husband and I felt it was time to move on; we just bought a 2015 Ford Focus, my first non-GM car. Even at this age and mileage, the engine and transmission are still in excellent condition. The air conditioning still runs as cold as it did back in 2004. I really will miss the unique design of the 2 rear half doors; they functioned better than a standard sedan since it was easier to open both doors and have a large space in which to load groceries and other items. I wish other car manufacturers caught on to this concept (the only other vehicle like that is my husband's Honda Element, which also has 2 rear half-doors). I am selling my car this weekend and will really hate to see it go, but it's time for a newer, more updated, and more dependable vehicle.",5

The battery to my surprise was located in the trunk. This was my fourth new car and the first that the battery lasted over 2 years. I guess with it being located in the trunk and away from all of the engine heat it was a good idea after all. It's not a sports car so when cornering at high rates of speed it kinda feels like it wants to get away from you. While driving the interior noise level is low. ",4.375

The bottom of the instrument panel cover gets caught on my shoe and pulls off all the time, it's very difficult to put back on.

In the year I've owned it, I'm averaging 28.63MPG with a heavy city driving bias.   Driving the car is lots of fun, it accelerates, brakes, and corners well. My only complaint about the handling is that the stock Firestone Affinity tires have horrible rain traction and squeal far too easily.  From a build quality perspective, I have had mixed feelings.  In terms of critical mechanical reliability, this car has been excellent.  The only critical item that failed was the DRL / Blinkers in the front of the car, which was subject to a recall anyhow.

Foremost, beware of the shoddy steering, which has an electric assist motor rather than a vacuum. This means the steering mistakes a bump in the road for the driver turning the wheel and pulls you off course with sudden and alarming  frequency. What control you do have is administed through a shrunken steering wheel which was miniaturized in consideration of easing the 3 seconds spent getting into and out of the car rather than the hours spent driving it. The wheel has a slippery texture and no indentations for a sense of grip. Taking the car in bends is harrowing",2.5

Shortly after the briskets and jam came out the hostess made the announcement a golden Saturn Ion was smoking profusely in the parking lot. My mother and I dashed to the ION and quickly popped the hood. After the smoke cleared we decided to drive the vehicle to the nearest authorized dealership. The car decided to cut off in the far left left lane of US I 85. Mother and I had just gotten the walker out of the trunk but didn't have time to grab the three spare oxygen tanks. We made it to the shoulder as mother screamed ""Holy Mother of pearl!"" and a semi trunk rear ended the Ion right in  the bosom. We don't remember much after that but the State trooper told us the oxygen tanks basically created a hydrogen bomb that propelled the ion 300 feet across the incoming lane. The tow truck driver told us that if it wasn't for the dry rotted frame and the irresponsibly placed gas tank (Saturn faulty designing for you) that the accident wouldn't have been half as bad. Needless to say I didn't make it to the wedding and the vows were destroyed. The marriage ended three years later due to a tax invasion scandal involving a dunkin doughnuts franchise.

About 60/40 driving conditions (city/highway), I get between 28-30 mpg.  It's not a very fast car (despite the way Saturn designed the exterior) but it will get you to where you need to go while sipping on fuel.  I do not like the interior.  The rear seating of the 2 door quad coupe is unbearable and not comfortable for anyone over about 5'7"" ish.  Good size trunk space.  The instrument cluster (speedometer and such) is in the center of the dash...kind of unnecessary.  If you you're a commuter and aren't looking for an over luxerious vehicle, this is for you.",3.875

It is an example of what I used to like about Saturn, not afraid to try something new.  How many times have you bought a new car and only months later, find that you have door dings all over it from parking?  Solution: Polymer body panels.  The center console some people hate but I just love it.  So much easier to see the instrumentation without having to look thru the steering wheel.  The engine is smooth and refined, but the trans could use a bit of tuning.  2nd to 3rd shift is a bit abrupt when cold.  The only service issue I have had in 50,000 miles are loose front stabilizer bushings.  Front seats a bit soft.  Very reliable so far.",4.375

It's the funnest car I have ever driven. It's reliable, sporty, beautiful, and low maitenance. The only things about it I would change are I would like it if it got a bit better gas mileage and the back seat is kinda cramped. I highly recommend one for those whom have no children or only a small child. We have driven this car to GA & Tennessee multiple times and it has always proven reliable.

The CD player also seems to have some weird thing where it detects when the music is too loud and automaticaly turns it down. That can be very annoying.

One was that the key could be removed from the ignition even when the car was running!  Crazy - but when I took to the dealer they refused to replace the ignition switch because they said it had been done 1 year prior.  If so they put another bad one in!  Next the gas tank leaked - and had to be replaced - $300.  Never had that happen to a car before!  Replaced a couple sensors and check engine light came on again a couple months later.

Then, at about 35,000 mi. the radio stopped working properly. The engine light came on. Saturn said engine light was caused by bad injector, replaced and problem still there. Some dummy lights would stay on and go off. Had to replace bearings. A lot of ride and engine noise, and front wheel noise, and brake vibration because disk is warped again. Seems to be some transmission problem with hard shift into first gear. So basically, a terrible car with too many problems at such low miles.    ",3.125

I had a 2001 Chrysler sebring Conv. with a 6 Cyl engine... it seemed that I got more MPG with that vehicle however it could be due to the fact that in the ION I dont notice when I am driving faster so I feel the need to push the gas harder.

I only have 22,000 miles on the car and the fabric in the driver's seat is coming loose. Also the light grey fabric throughout the interior stains extremely easily. This is more apparent as you own the car for a year at least and anything will stain the seats/carpet.  At 18000 miles the driver window fasteners failed and the window was loose inside the frame.

My only complaint is the components used to make this car are cheap. Seals and other plastic parts have not held up well. I had to reseal the windshield because the seal went bad and it started leaking. I'm also concerned about a possible leak in the sunroof. I also drove it under snowy conditions and it handled well.

Wheel bearings, front bushings, AC gone, multiple check engine light problems that result in expensive repairs or a mechanic who can't find the problem as it comes and goes. I've sunk more money into this car in just a handful of years than I did in all the years of owning cars previously. Since I wrote this review, I was able to refresh the AC for cheap and it's been working fine. But the check engine light continues to come on and go off randomly, I've had to replace the muffler (twice), tie rods, steering column, fuel lines, and the shocks, struts and springs. There may be more. I can't even remember now. I'm trying to save up for a down payment on a new (used) car, but this thing keeps sucking away all my money.Update 6/1/17: I still have this car. It's still not the best. But after replacing pretty much every suspension related part on it, it's been ok for the past couple years. (I really shouldn't say that because now something will go wrong with it.) The check engine light continues to come on and off, but other than that the car has been ok.

The large cargo area with independent folding rear and front seats and rear doors make this coupe a great value.

This is only one of their great line, but I chose the ION for the sport of driving.  Manual shift for total control of this Ion-3 2.4 175HP. Totally functional, plenty of room, the doors for the rear are cool too. All in all, this car is fun. It moves when I ask it to, and I hate being on highways when I'm in overdrive, because there's no shifting necessary. At the same time, the cruise control works perfectly with the manual shift overdrive. Before I get home though, I take a few trips around the block to keep the shifting going. Of course, if you prefer less work, you get the same fun out of this car. This car ranks up there with my favorite cars",5

For years we suffered with the ignition and spent countless hours waiting for the alarm to ""reset"" so that we could once again attempt to start the vehicle. But the thing that makes you the most upset is that the mechanics at the Saturn dealer act like they had never heard of this problem before. It was like Christmas day when GM was forced to make the ignition/key problem a recall and fortunately for us it took care of all of the starting problems and we could once again not have to worry about leaving the house 15 minutes early for fear of the car not starting. But now it's started having a problem with the 'enginge light"" coming on in relation with the evac system.  First we replaced the gas cap, ($15) then the purge solenoid and the vent control, ($197.) after that didn't work, we are currently dropping the gas tank replacing the 'pressure solenoid' another ($237) I don't know if this is GM's fault or simply that American auto makers can not manufacture good electrical components because my Jeep Grand Cherokee needed several solenoids and eventually a new PCM and my new Cadillac SRX is having issues with it's computer and traction control  system. (Fortunately the Cad is under warranty) When it comes to the end of the day the Ion has been a pretty good car, a little bumpy and rickety but actually is not any worse than my new Cad when it comes to the electronics. I don't understand how anyone could say they hate this car or that it is a piece of junk? These people must just think that all you do to a car is put gas in it and go!

Of course I had little problems here and there, nothing major. I shouldn't have bought a new model of car the first year it came out. I should have waited till 2004 to buy the ION after all the little kinks where worked out. Overall I was pretty satisfied with the ION. Only broke down on my once in 6 years.

Had many issues with my Ion that I purchased new in 2003.  Have had the ""no start"" issue, the OEM tires were horrible, the back brakes were faulty, and had numerous issues in the FWD linkage.  Plus, engine and road noise are terrible, mileage was disappointing for this engine (22 HWY in MN winter, 25 HWY in summer) and the interior materials are cheap, cheap, cheap.

Unfortunately, this car disappointed at every turn. Poor performance, with a loud engine, horrible road noise and terrible mileage (currently at about 26 hwy with driver only). Interior layout looked innovative but in all practicality it just doesn't work. Driver's seat is the most uncomfortable I've ever experienced.  And the GM passlock issue has reared its ugly head with my model, though no recall has been issued.  I made a horrible decision considering the Corolla, Civic, or Sentra were all much better vehicles for the same price at the time of purchase.  It is a mistake I will not make again.",1.75

Have not had the build issues others reported -- recalls were done quickly and everyone was friendly. My CD player doesn't skip and noise is what I'd expect for a car this size. Center console display is cool and looks much sharper than a Corolla from 2003. Plastic body means no dents; trunk is nice. 5 speed automatic is nice for extra oomph in passing or city accelleration.

The 2.2L is pretty peppy in regards to a 4 banger and the 5 speed manual is a little sloppy but still fun. It stops well, turns on a dime and I think very fun to drive.

Problem was fixed in 2005 model year. Ride is comfortable, seats stink, not enough support.  Economy is okay at 29MPG average. Stereo was replaced 3 times in first year, but no other problems. Car is reliable transportation for short trips, not for long distances. Stay away from snow/ice, traction is poor at best. Excellent on dry pavement. Braking is very good.

The only repair issue has been a faulty oxygen sensor. The engine is decent for power and gets 30 mpg. The transmission does well enough but doesn't impress.  The interior is touchy.  The center instrument panel takes getting used to. The cup holders are badly placed, the seats are stiff and anything will stain the upholstery. The plastic interior and fans develop squeaking problems that require some mild garage rework to silence. The trunk has lots of space but has a small aperture.

There were a few downsides to buying a car the first year it was offered.  1)I had to deal with a few recalls 2)The ION back then was more expensive than the newer IONs . 3) OnStar (and I think satellite radio) were not options on '03 models. This is a fun car to drive and overall I really enjoy the ION. However, Saturn parts are more expensive than most other makes, some parts have to be ordered and while I do drive a lot, I have had to put an estimated $5,000 into repairs.",4

It's cute, reliable and cheap, but best of all it doesn't look or drive like a cheap car. It's a small car that doesn't drive like a small car.

Also, my auto transmission had a shift flare issue which the dealership fixed under warranty by replacing the valve body.  Lastly, I had my left front wheel bearing go bad around 50,000. I don't know how people who have reviewed this car drive to get their poor gas mileage, but I've been very satisfied with mine.  I get 22-25mpg city, and 34-36mpg highway.

My father has the same model ION3 that I do and his mileage is even worse than mine: 12 city, 19 highway. This is unacceptable.  Also, there is nearly no leg room in the back seat. It's extremely uncomfortable back there. The novelty of having the instrument panel in the middle of the dash, rather than behind the steering wheel wears off rather quickly.

At first it was fun going back to the dealership but now it's not so fun.  Also,  at 50 grand the  left axle went which is ok seeing how the warranty covered it.

The fact that the car is basically dent proof is another plus, i was in two accidents with this car and there is literally not a scratch on it. it's slow compared to other cars but gives you NO problems.

We live in farming country and we needed a car that can go for a long time and hold our growing family. In 2016 we bought the Outlook from a small dealer around the Twin Cities area in MN. Test drove nicely, took it out on the road, opened it up, drove 5hrs home in it with no problems. Twenty-Four hours later the alternator went, we took it in to the mechanic (standing appointment, trusted mechanic) and found out that the breaks were toast, the tires were bad, the battery was nearly dead so we replaced all these things. Fast forward to November 2017, the winters in ND get COLD, the Outlook is fuel injected so we were told that we wouldn't need a block heater. I went out to start it one morning and it would not start. Had it towed to our local mechanic and turned out the timing chain was gone. If you know anything about cars you would know how expensive that chain is. My husbands a disabled war Veteran, we have 4 kids, and a very limited income so we had to wait till tax season in February 2018 to get that fixed. Fast forward to May 2018 and while in town, an hour away from home, the transmission went. Its the end of July now and the Outlook is sitting the garage collecting dust because we can not afford to put a new transmission into a car that we have already sunk over $5000 into above the price we paid for it. We still owe a years worth of payments on a car we can not drive. I regret buying the Outlook. What makes me really sad is that we own a 2003 Saturn ION series 2. It was made in America, has over 200,000 miles on it and still runs like a top. The Outlook I have learned was made in China and is crap.",5

Things still were not up to par, however, even after the extended warranty ended and we were left with dealing with the problems on our own.

I really like the design of this vehicle inside and out. My main complaint is that it has major problem after major problem. The only good thing is that so far everything has been under warranty. The first thing to go was the rack and pinion at 30,000 miles. At around 35,000 miles the right strut started leaking and had to be replaced. It started leaking again at 60,000 miles, I dont know if its bad luck for me or a design flaw. The next thing to go was the water pump at 50,000. Finally at 68,000 miles the transmission went. Thankfully it was still under warranty (with only two months to spare) and the dealership had to replace 3rd, 5th and reverse gears. Overall this has been the most unreliable vehicle I have ever owned. I would never recommend this vehicle to anybody. All owners appear to have the same main problems and I cant believe General Motors doesnt offer some type of buyback program as they did for the Vue. ",2.875

She saw the Acadia when it came out, and fell in love, but the Saturn is the best bang for the buck in the Lambda platform. We were able to buy a well- epuipped Outlook for less than base Acadia money. We found the Enclave(the Traverse would also) to be much harder to see out of because of the ramped up rear side window and small back glass. The Outlook has the 2nd best-looking interior after only the Enclave. It is averaging a true 18.9 mpg, which is better than I expected. It is very smooth, has a quiet ride, with very decent power for a 4600# car. I never thought I'd buy a Saturn, but after year 1, I'm glad we did",5

We have now had our Saturn for 1 1/2 years and we remain extremely satisfied. In addition to wonderful build quality, the interior design is outstanding. I am 6' 1"" and my 13 year old son is well on his way there. With the second row captains chairs, he and I can comfortably and easily get into the third row seat, far easier than any other vehicle we tried.   A great surpise:  After changing my flat tire (which was quite easy) I found that Saturn had put a large plastic bag in a storage area so that the dirty damaged tire could be stored in the back so as not to make any mess!

Took it in twice- Mechanic says I'm getting 16/22. It broke down out of state. Had to have computer replaced at 2000 miles. The passenger seat bottom had to be put back on.

The vehicle is rated at 16 MPG city but we struggle to get 12. It would be different if the vehicle was driven hard but it's driven very slow in a fairly small town that you don't drive over 35 MPH. I've had the vehicle back to 2 Saturn dealerships 4 times and they can't seem to figure out why it gets the poor mileage. The last Saturn dealer told me they drove it and got over 16 MPG. I offered to ride with them to verify their claim and they refused. My wife loves the vehicle but if I knew it was going to get 12 MPG I would have bought another vehicle with a V-8 engine.,4.375

Fortunately, our checkbook steered us to the Outlook!  Much more affordable, even with leather seats and DVD. Enclave had softer ride, but lots of pricy ""extras"" that we really didn't need anyway. Acadia was in-between priced, but maybe even more truck-like. Our FWD Outlook has good MPG 22HWY and 20 mixed without much break-in yet.

Had to take it back about 6 times within that period to have them fix a shifting issue that repeatedly was not fixed and replace a radio. They ended up putting a new engine in it but wouldn't give me more details. Basically if it was in cruise mode it wouldn't downshift correctly up/down hills and would stay up if you weren't paying attention, fixed if manually lowered speed. Also service stabilitrack warning that would turn off if car restarted (electrical issues are big with this car). Later in its life it would randomly not shift and keep ramping rpn's while first driving unless you shut off and restarted after maybe a minute. Usually I could catch it when leaving work and just pull over. Electrical issues like seat sensor went out on passenger side ($800 estimate), check engine light since around 120k that the dealership couldn't diagnose and claimed they'd have to replace multiple wiring harnesses. Alternator lasted to 240k so pretty good, expensive to replace though, $600 due to its location. Service parts are expensive for this car and often difficult to install, at least in comparison to my husbands Chevy truck (2004). Love driving the car though, interior and size is perfect for me and my new baby. Good space for groceries and big holiday trips.

We had to pay $600 for repairs when hundreds of others had complained to GM about the same problem. GM has a recall/bulletin on the exterior lights but say our VIN number is not included so even thought we have the exact problem they won't even listen to us b/c of the VIN number. Crazy!

It's a little worse than a turbo-charged car - could complete a laundry cycle before it downshifts. But kinda got used to it by now. Also the gas mileage is not all that it advertises to be.

Definitely a transmission problem with this vehicle.   After I had the update  transmission got worst.   In Jan 08, I was driving along one day and I started to hear this loud noise coming from the back that sounded like an airplane. Took in for service they said that the wheel bearings had gone bad.  On the day I had the wheel bearings replaced, while I was driving home my steering wheel became really tight like it had no power steering took it back the pump in the steering wheel needed to be replaced.

I test drove the Highlander, the Pilot, Toyota's RAV4,and Mazda's CX9 before testing the Saturn so I could have some basis other than looks for my final decision. I saved the Saturn test drive for last. I was immediately impressed with the size, relatively nimble handling, ride, and instrument cluster in the FWD XR that I drove. The transmission shifting seemed a little awkward. Downshifting for passing seemed to engage a bit later than I was used to but when it did happen the power was quite adequate.The Nav system gets more friendly with use. The White Diamond Tricoat looks great and I feel good driving this car. ",4.625

(5 grandkids) Came out of a Mercury Grand Marquis and have been really surprised at how much quieter and more comfortable this one is. We have made two extended trips so far and I am not impressed with the gas mileage getting 21.1 overall on both trips. Being a realist, this is about what I would expect from a vehicle of this size. My problem with the mileage is it is too far off from the estimates for it to not be intentional in my opinion maybe to keep from scaring some people away. We have yet to find anything bad about the car. Take a serious look at this one if you need more than 5 seats",4.5

We drove both, but in the end we liked the Saturn better. The ride in this car is it's best feature. It also has adjustable middle captains chairs which helps when you have someone tall riding in the middle seats.

1039, on 01/15/17 17:28 PM (PST),Bethany ,2009 Saturn Outlook SUV XR 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Looks can be deceiving," This car had everything we wanted.  As a family of 4 with two dogs, we needed the extra space.  The interior offers lots of room with a stylish exterior.  It's the sister version of the GMC Acadia, and when we purchased it in 2013 it was thousands less with the same luxuries.  First, we paid way too much for it at the dealer (our own fault), and now that we are looking to trade it in we are getting horrible offers because it is a discontinued brand, despite the fact that it's loaded with accessories.  I am so glad we purchased the extended warranty when we bought it.  For the first three years it was in the shop at least once a year for something, each time costing us $1,000 or more.  We just recently had to replace a coil pack to the tune of $800, and now we are still experiencing problems with the engine.  A few months ago it started shifting weird, almost feeling like you were driving over rumble strips when the engine was around 2,000 rpms and going about 40 mph. Even though there is nothing coming up as an issue at the dealership, it still doesn't feel right and I don't trust driving it.  It feels like the engine could just quit at any moment.  The ""chrome look"" grill has started to bubble and peel away.  The seating track for the second row has begun to rust and doesn't slide easily, and the DVD is touch and go.  I currently am getting 13.5 mpg city and 17 highway, and even though it's great in the snow it's a gas and oil hog, most likely due to the AWD.  As much as we love the safety features and spaciousness of this vehicle, it has been an expensive vehicle to own and maintain, and we would certainly not recommend it.",2

Apparently, this is ""standard"" for these engines. Then, at 108k, the engine needed to be replaced altogether. GM was going to charge us $9k for the job. After paying to have the engine replaced by my mechanic, it is time to let the car go (my mechanic told me to sell it long ago). My window switches also don't work; I'm not sure that's an across the board problem like the other issues, but I thought I would mention it, because the dealership told me that they ""couldn't duplicate the problem"" (even though the passenger switches obviously don't work if you try to put the windows down).

The only drawback is the transmission is a little sluggish when trying to excelerate in automatic mode. The problem is reduced when you use manual mode. If you know you are coming up on a situation like entering a crowded interstate you'll need to manually downshift to 4 or 5 to be able to have sufficient power to merge. The first time I did this I was in automatic mode and scared the hell out of me. The another minor item is when filling the tank. Be aware that a sleeve is in the opening so the nosel is partically sealed triggering shutoff prematurely. I can get another 2-3 gallon in the tank by pulling the nosel back when filling.,4.875

The Saturn 4-cyl. is a very good match for this vehicle.  The 4 speed auto trans. works very well, but I like the Venza 6-speed better.  The Saturn has a very comfortable ride and has a great deal of room inside.  The driver sits nice and high and this vehicle has an extra fat steering wheel, which I also like.  The as built quality looks to be as good as the Toyota.  The price makes the Saturn Vue an excellent value in the market, even as we see GM going through all of this change.

The V-6 is a very good engine and has plenty of power. It handled great in the snow last winter. The only complaints I have are the tires seem to be wearing out faster than I would have anticipated even though they are filled with nitrogen gas and maintains the recommended pressure in both hot and cold weather. The rear cargo cover gets in the way of hauling larger items. I like the exterior and interior styling. I'm glad I got the V- 6 AWD. I did my research before I bought and was a little scared that the 4 cylinder would not be powerful enough for the weight of the vehicle,4.625

Only have a couple of complaints -1 being the fuel economy.it's about 5-6 mpg less than my Honda powered 06. i'm sure part is due to the extra weight (500#)but also to the fact the the engine is now GM built.and 2,the torque steer is worse than my 06.but overall better",4.625

The comfort of the interior is much higher than several leading competitors we considered.  The V6 XR is recommended over the V4 because of the vehicle's weight.  The 3.6 V6 is refined and smooth.  Gas mileage could be better - but a steel unibody and a wealth of standard safety features are worth some trade off.  A great vehicle, despite a couple irksome fit and finish repairs that were fully covered under warranty.  Perhaps the best product that's come out under the Saturn label.

From before I have a '98 Grand Cherokee 5.9L V8 and the only thing that can compare, is the performance! The Vue and I are usually long ahead of the rest, leaving the red light. The Vue is nice and ""tight"", while the G.C. is like a ship in high sea. Are however more pleased with the automatic AC in the G.C. The VUE's automatic AC feels to be of a ""cheaper"" type.

All 3 vehicles have well exceeded 200000 miles with just normal wear and tear repairs. The plastic panels held up excellent to our New York winters of snow, slush, and salt. Even the undercarriage held up well, never having to replace any fuel, brake lines or structural parts. Why didn't these consumer mags ever mention the durability of these vehicles.

Then there was an awful squeak in the front end - Warranty $100.00. Then the front left wheel bearing went - Warranty $100.00. Then the computer went again and this time nothing in the truck would shut off and it sat on the tow truck and at Saturn until the battery went - Warranty $400.00 fought and got 100.00 back (battery cost over 100.00?) Then the rear right wheel bearing went - $100.00. And now the Front Rotors are bad and I am doing them myself... Service dept doesn't even ask if it's warrantied until they come and ask you to sign for the total amount for repairs?  ,2.875

Bridgestone tires are horrible in snow and even rain. Loud wind noise on opposite windows in any type of crosswind. Rear seats recline ""almost"" as much as coach airline seats. AWD is very slow to engage when front wheels spin.  <20mpg in city driving. No problems in 15K miles other than to replace tires with all season.",3.75

Now with nearly 30k miles, I've had a new transmission, fuel pump, various gaskets, left front strut mount replaced.  Now the right front strut mount is making a rattle.  It got terrible gas mileage since day one. (16 city, 18-20 hwy). On the bright side, when they replaced all the above parts, my gas mileage has improved.  I'm now getting 20.6 city and 26+ on the highway. That's fine, however, I seem to spend a lot of commuting time back and forth to the dealership.

I've done all the oil and filter changes myself so other than a few tire rotations, cost to maintain has been very low. Front end started to rumble at 24k, so I has that taken care of at the dealership under warranty, and they said it was the top strut mounts and front disc brake pins. Most of the noise is gone. Drives great, starts up everytime, lots of power, good gas mileage considering the power. I have not experienced the fit and finish problems others have had, but I don't deny they might be there.

The experience has been beyond our expectation. I don't know about any other years or models, but the 2006 V-6 FWD has a Honda engine in it. It has more raw horsepower than most sports cars that I have driven. It is rated in the low-mid 200 HP. Driving this thing is like an SUV on steroids. The traction control coupled with the engine performance makes this SUV a must-own. If anyone is looking for a mid-size SUV with performance, this is it!

The dent resistant panels may keep dents away but they are starting to come undone at the bottom so when you open the back doors the panel catches and the door has to be shut and opened again. This is not covered by the warranty either. I have had one door that would neither open nor close (at 8000 mi) and twice the locks froze up so the door will not shut until it thaws 30 miles from home w/ 2 infants in back.

After one (1) month of tooling around, both in city and on the highway, we could not be more pleased and content with our new VUE!  She's got exceptional power and pickup whenever circumstances requires it. That Honda Vtech 3.5l Vtech V6 mill is simply amazing!! Yet, she's easily twice as fuel friendly as our old SUV.

The materials and design have been significantly improved from the original and the Red Line package provides a sportier ride with more supportive seats and a distinctive look. Although the gas mileage started off around 18-20 mpg in the city, we are averaging 25-26 mpg on the highway and expect performance and mileage to improve as the engine breaks in. There is plenty of utility to this small SUV as the split-folding rear seats provide a great compromise between hauling people and hauling stuff.

The V6 engine, along with the 5- speed automatic transmission, provides great acceleration.  The fuel economy is good considering the engine's power.  The ride is quiet and smooth.  The cabin offers plenty of space and has comfortable seats.  The new GM stereo head unit is nice and easy to use.  My only complaint about the vehicle is the obvious cost-cutting tactics that GM used, such as a manual seatback on what is supposed a power driver seat. Toyota or Honda would probably offer a true power seat.  Side airbags, or any safety feature for that matter, should be standard. Shows a lack of commitment to safety on GM's part.",4.625

1196, on 07/14/18 16:06 PM (PDT),Allen Pack ,2006 Saturn VUE SUV 4dr SUV (2.2L 4cyl 4A),Reliable and Practical," The Saturn Vue, in my case at least, has been extremely reliable. Bought it used with 97,000 miles on it. Only had to do standard maintenance so far, including changing the brakes out and getting a tune-up at the 125,000 mile mark, putting on new tires, changing the battery once, and getting an oil change every 3,000 miles. I have the 2.2 liter Ecotec 4 cylinder mated to a 4 speed auto. transmission, and I gotta say the power is lacking from this pair. I don't care too much about speed, but this thing is slow. Just out of curiosity I did time it, and it takes just about 11 seconds to get from 0-60 mph. Fuel economy is okay, I can average anywhere from 21-25 mpg, it just depends on what my commute demands out of my foot on the gas pedal. Also, running the A/C which is ice cold, on these 100° Texas Summer days will take a toll on the fuel economy. Overall storage space and roominess is actually excellent for being a compact SUV. Soft touch materials all throughout the cabin are nice, and the captains chairs up front  are super comfortable. Even though I replaced the radio and sound system entirely, the stock set up is decent for those who want to keep it simple and have good sound quality. Wind noise is kind of bad, but ride comfort from the Mapherson Struts are nice. I personally  have to take it slower in the rain because this vehicle hydro planes like crazy, although that could be just a combination of the tires I put on and me. Overall, I would highly recommend this vehicle as a cheaper reliable small family hauler/ beater vehicle, but if you want something to use as nothing but a commuter, unless you just want an SUV, I'd look for a compact sedan.",4

Had minor work done on driver side door as it needed to be adjusted to keep the entry lights off. Replaced tie-ends. Very minor stuff. Bumps are a bit noisy but are just an undesired design feature as the mounts are easily loosened. It is not a safety issue at all. I have no problem with wind noise. I have read other reviews stating that the Vue does not handle well in the snow. I disagree with this and chalk it up as driver error. I have had no problems in our North Dakota winters at all. I've made it out of some pretty deep drifts and severe ice conditions. ",4.625

For a fuse replacement in the radio itself! I've owned three Saturns; this will be my last.

They're nice to look at, but if you plan on taking a trip in one, you can plan on hearing lots of noise from your vehicle, as well as, all the others on the road, and you may want to make alternate plans in case your Vue breaks down-- you also may want to add an extra day or two into your trip b/c I've waited on tow trucks for hours!

Dimensions are OK for me, big enough to haul a small family around town (including baby stuffs) and roomier like other thirstier and more expensive SUVs. The front seats can be better; they have an uncomfortable haunch at the back. The new interior design is very good with a lot of standards.

If you drive the 4 cylinder automatic near the speed limit you will get over 30mpg highway.  After more than 10K miles no problems and gas mileage is great.  It does have pep for a 4 cylinder though it will degrade gas mileage quickly if you race it around.  I use an iPod with the aux input.  Just buy a 3.5mm to 3.5mm jack from RadioShack.

Before this, we had the V-6 L300,  and the VUE feels underpowered in comparison, but it's an SUV that gets good gas milage.  The reviewer commented on the cheapness of the interior, but that was the 2002 model.  I think the brushed aluminum look in the 2006 model is very nice.

There is also a passenger airbag display on the dash.  The steering wheel includes radio controls and cruise controls.  Electric/power locks and windows are also standard.  Best of all, the price for the 2006 is actually less than the 2005.  Moreover, the gas mileage is still good for an SUV (i.e., 22 city/27 hwy).

It now has 152,000 on it.  So I had a bit of a decision to make now.  It needed lots of work, primarily new brake pads, and drums, rear shocks mainly from rust, had to repair front wheel well frame from rust etc. couple other minor things to pass inspection.  Bottom line it was about $1200 of work.  That's what you get with a 13 year old car in the northeast.  My guy says that it actually in good shape mechanically and is pretty solid to go after the repairs. So I did it.  Its a fun car to drive and hey it would cost me a lot more to buy another used car.

It was once said this has a Honda engine and transmission but everything else is Saturn (GM), I find that to be true. Mine is at around 160,000 miles and still running strong. That being said I have replaced the AC 3 times, one of my wheel bearings has been replaced, the plastic near the back door fell off but I screwed it back on because it's plastic. The seat on the driver's side has a tear in it from getting in and out of the car and the heater for this driver seat does not work. The blinker works most of the time but when it doesn't I need to wiggle the hazard light button. Once we took this car to the drive-in and in order to have the car on without lights we needed to turn it off pull the e-brake turn it back on but then we also needed to remove the interior lights in the front which broke the plastic cover. The rear-view mirror is loose so I need to readjust it when I go over a heavy bump, the paint on the plastic Dash inside the car is peeling off and the defroster on the back window is not working anymore. But hey it's got a Honda engine and transmission so with a roll of duct tape I might be able to go for a while still.",4

Overall, I am satisfied with the vehicle.  Engine is fantastic - nice power and mileage.  I have not had any significant maintenance expenses until recently.  My biggest complaint are the brakes - really bad front pulsations that require the rotors to be refinished every 12K miles.  Just replaced front stab bar links (very creaky) and right rear wheel bearing/hub assembly - it was producing very loud road noise.  I plan on keeping this vehicle as long as I can and so far it has been a nice car.  I just wish I knew of a better front brake combination than OEM parts.",3.625

Gas mileage is great on the road (26 mpg) and good around town (20 mpg).  I've had the most trouble with sunroof leaking but keeping the drain lines  cleaned out seems to have solved that problem.  Replaced right wheel bearing around 35K and the radio and tires just this year.  I've really liked this car, the size is perfect.  We got the side air bags.  I hope to keep it for many more years.

It currently has 119,000 miles on it, and the only thing that has ever gone wrong with it is the pull cable for the hood release, and the light cluster panel above the driver needed a new switch.

My biggest complaint in the vue is the brakes.  I have 100k miles and have replaced the rear (i believe) brakes 5 times! Pads and rotors!  Yet NEVER the front ones (the pads once). The wind noise from the windows drives me crazy.  The sun visor is way too small for the size of the windshield.  I agree with other owners the engine noise is loud.  I have major rust on the hatch/trunk door and the rear driver side door never closes unless you slam it.

I have replaced a front left hub-wheel bearing that cost $455 and ever since 48,000 miles there has been a rumbling noise from under the hood and under neath the center of the suv.  The dealership mechanic say's that there are nothing mechanical to explain these noises!  So I guess I have to be satisfied with paying $30,000 and having a problematic car. Unbelieveable!

The Pilot was too expensive and bigger than what I wanted and the CRV seemed underpowered to me. I looked at Nissan and Toyota but didn't find anything that was comfortable, reasonably priced and had some power. I read that the Saturn vue V6 was powered by a Honda 3.5 liter engine which I was familiar with as it is the same engine in the Odessy and Pilot. It only took one test drive for me to fall in love with this SUV. I have been driving mine now for over four years and just love it.

(69k on it in 39 months) No major complaints other than Saturn reneging on a warranty repair to the radio (it would not keep time) earlier this year. The '04 has a Honda engine - about the only reason we haven't traded it in given our other difficulties with Saturn of late. Rear seat legroom is a bit cramped in the VUE. The audio system (6-disc in-dash changer) is a good one, and the original tires held up a full 60k before being replaced. It could use more than the front airbags, and the rear drum brakes, even though ABS, are a drawback as well.",3.875

The few times I have had any issues, I have had them resolved quickly and cordially, and this is true regardless of dealership. This, combined with the terrific styling, size, power, fuel consumption and price of this vehicle make me a head-over- heels happy owner. The only thing that is slightly below-par is the quality of interior items. The fit and finish as the car reviewers would call it. There is a lot of lightweight plastic in the interior. I'm sure the amount of plastic helps lower the price, and raise the fuel economy and performance (due to lighter weight).",5

The 17 inch wheels and tires create some low speed rumbles but they more than compensate on road trips. The finish in and out still looks new and the impression when clean is an impressive appearance. The recent shift I made from driving 30,000 miles a year to 10,000 showed poorer mileage in stop and go. The 6 likes to be run long trips to reach the 24-28 mpg I get on 60+ mile 75+ MPH trips.

And the resale value is horrible. Purchase a car for $24,000 and drive one year and get offered $12,800 for a trade on a new 2005 Vue. This tells me what Saturn thinks of there vehicle.

No heated seats or heated mirrors was a disapointment when you consider that it is an SUV to be used in in the North country in snow. Why else would you want an AWD?

Bought this car pre-owned in mid-2016 (it's now Jan 2018), with very low mileage (now has 75k), in good condition, mostly used for work commute. Had basically no complaints for the first year, seeing as I just needed a reliable car to drive for personal use mostly in big cities. But since then it all went downhill FAST. First, heating/cooling system broke on its own. Couldn't get it replaced within budget since shops don't carry Saturn. Living in a cold climate most of the year my windows are ALWAYS fogged. Doesn't help during hot summers either. Then, electrical problems started happening randomly. It would auto-unlock when locking from the inside, leaving the car unlocked and interior lights on while driving - VERY annoying. Not reliable if you have to park on streets (which I do). Opening the front doors from the inside are a pain, with the need to push the doors harder than needed and even sometimes needing the window down to unlock from outside. Then, since I live in Seattle, it rains a lot and the driver's door started leaking rain onto my lap! Not only rain but melted snow too, leaving me without a heater AND freezing water dripping on me at times. Brakes are a bust, even after servicing. Very uncomfortable to sit in. Interior is very cheap. Looks dirty easily. Only pros are the AWD, large cargo room, and decent stereo system. But since the brakes are crap it isn't very stable even in rain. Better off with a CR-V. Do NOT buy this car used... I feel sorry for myself even having it in the first place since I can't even trade it in! Like I said, not even worth $100 (believe me- I just tried trading it in today!)",3
1313, on 08/06/16 08:33 AM (PDT),Andrew Paul ,2004 Saturn VUE SUV Fwd 4dr SUV (2.2L 4cyl 5M),American cheapness., A cheap American car made of cheap plastics. Makes a ton of noise when you drive it. No finess to the suspension at all. The gear box is jerky. But none the less it is a reliable car and it is all because of the 2.2 cylinder V4 HONDA engine in the car. That's right. These GM cars came stock from the Tennessee factory with HONDA engines. A little misleading on GM's part. The car also gets good gas mileage because it is light but because it is so light you get tossed around like a sail in the wind if you are on the highway. The seats also fold down so you get a lot of cargo room if you ever need it.,3

Paint just falls off this car on the plastic body panals. Breaks are crap, calipers freeze up ruining rotors. Road noise, leaks from moonroof, and forget about keeping the seats or carpet clean water will stain them. Comfort ? Put a pillow behind your back on long drives or you will be hurting. I wanna get rid of it but it runs still ok, timing chain makes noise on start up but it has been like that for 4 years or so. Parts are cheap to buy but they are cheap quality and don't last. The best thing about this vue is the cargo room and mpg, 21 to 27. I always bought us made cars ford's dodge and lots of gm. Saturn, Pontiacs and  chevys and this one cost me the most to own.

The settlement is bittersweet, since owners have to front the $5,000-$6,000 and wait for the replacement.  The transmission flaw was never addressed so you get the same loser the second/third time.  Decided to get away from it and traded for a Honda CR-V yesterday. Do your own research on the transmission.  ",4

I traded a civic for it as I needed more room for the weekend projects. My kids love it and it has a great ride. The 2.2 liter-4-cylinder motor provides enough power and cruise stays locked on regardless of the hills. I average 25mpg with mixed driving and don't notice the road noise mentioned by a previous review. It is likely the noise from the previous review is due to the tires. ,4.5

I bought mine used at around 56k miles, towed horses with it for a little while, then packed my life into a 12' UHaul trailer, hooked it up, and moved across the country. No problems with it, just regular maintenance now at over 100k miles. I love taking her on long road trips of 10 hours or more, and have even taken her up on tight logging roads while towing with no problems at all. I don't have AWD on mine, just the V6, but she's gotten me out of multiple sticky situations with her front wheel drive. Mountain driving is an absolute blast in this car. You can really feel her dip and grip on tight winding roads and can easily add a healthy 15 MPH to any suggested curve speed for fun driving. There's plenty of cargo space before including the fold down back seats, plenty of little storage compartments, and one nicely sized hidden compartment under the front cup holders.  Visibility is fantastic for an SUV. You can cover all blind spots easily. The one downside to this car, really, is the outside noise. The doors don't have the best seal, and in really windy areas it can startle you with a huge gush. I drove 8 hours through the Washington Gorge and dealt with it pretty constantly, but the stereo volume gets loud enough to drown it out. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this car. Over the past 5 years she and I have become a singular being, and I trust her to take me anywhere and everywhere until she just can't continue anymore.",5

I've taken it on many road trips from Florida to Canada and lots of places in between. I travel from VA to TN quite a bit and love the power that I have climbing through the mountains and it seemingly doesn't sacrifice much on gas mileage to do so. My most recent trip took me from central Va, to Central Tn to August, Ga and then back to VA again. Lots of mountanous terrain and I got about 25 miles to the gallon on the whole trip. There is plenty of space and it's a comfortable ride. Love the back as well and the handy compartments for storing things. Would absolutely buy it again.",5

The Vue outperforms and is much roomier than the Subaru's. I love the all wheel drive, room, the dent resistant panels which are no longer available in 2008. Come on Saturn bring them back!  That was what made your product unique. I love my Redline. Too bad they had to change it.

The bumper kits and side skirts look great, giving it a lower look. Plus the black on black color looks great.

I was hesitant because I was getting 30 mpg with the Tiburon. I only have 400 miles on the VUE so after it breaks in I am sure I will get at least 1 mpg better. So far I drove 102 highway miles filled up with 3.3 gallons and got 30.7 mpg. Then I drove 59.5 city miles filled up with 2.02 gallons for 29.5 mpg and finally 82.2 mostly highway miles filled up with 2.7 gallons for 30.4 mpg. Granted I haven't gone faster than 65 mph but usually don't.  I think the main factor for the mileage is resisting the temptation of accelerating hard. Nice and gradual and it pays off!

The interior look, with the wood- grained panels, and clean finish makes the Vue look more expensive than it really is.

I really like the way the interior looks and the comfort of the seats, as compared with many of the other SUV models I test-drove.

A little odd if you accelerate around corners quickly though. Sometimes it feels as if the wheel gets stickier in your turn direction if you go too fast around a turn.

Get the sunroof air deflector; it eliminates horrendous noise when the sunroof is opened.  Rooftop cross rails are pretty, but not sure if they are needed.

The ignition was bad, the keys would get stuck and it became impossible to start on several occasions, in fact the service guys at the GM dealership could not get it started when it was brought in for oil changes. the heated seats stopped working, the power windows slip down and rattle, the ball bearings and brakes went bad and the rear lift gate began to rust and bubble under the chrome emblem.",2

After several visits to the shop to identify and correct noise we decided to live with the noise.  Two years later a vehicle started shuddering when stopping.

It has been wonderful for my two large dogs. I've had a generally good experience with the dealership, with the exception that they charged me $25 over the quote the last time I had it serviced, however, the oil change was a decent price rather than the $95 that had charged me previously. The plastic seat-mount cracked. I've had no other problems with the vehicle.  Before my Saturns, I drove a Jag.  Hey, it is not a Jag, but for the money, I can afford to step down a few notches.

We talked to customer service at Saturn and they told us that the noise it is making now is a lumbering noise that is probably sheet metal flexing when you go over bumps. Nothing they can fix. Incredible! Something is wrong in the front end and it is definitely a safety issue and they won't do anything about it. We need help before bearings go out again!",2.5

Inexpensive SUV, and shows it. After the compressor went out, I decided I didn't want to see what would happen once the warranty expired at 36,000 miles, and traded it in for a Nissan Xterra.

I average mid to high 20's in a mix of city and highway driving, and have topped out at 31mpg on a long trip up the coast. Many cars of the same size can't compete with that, let alone other small SUV's that often have less cargo space.  This car is by no means a luxury vehicle, but for around $18k brand new with a 100,000 mile warranty, it's hard to beat for a daily driver.

Pickup is what you would expect from a 4 cylinder, but it's great for around town driving!

Rear seats can be fold down so you will have plenty of cargo room. No cargo cover though, not even a design let you put one so no after market cargo cover either. I knew the 4 cyl one will have less power so I got the manual one to better control it. Still powerless. I push for 4k~5k rpm on 1st gear but it is still slow. Mileage is OK, better than other SUVs. I get 21.3 local and 23~24 on highway. If you stay around 65 mph on hiway you will get better mileage but that is too slow for me. About 3.7K rpm at 80mph.

We've had to pay for more repairs than we thought when we originally purchased the car. Also, because the car is a hybrid, the engine is arranged differently than other models of the Vue, which means more expensive repairs. This means that even simple repairs almost always require taking it in to be serviced. Because Saturn only made this model for one year, parts are hard to come by, even for the dealer, which means that they cost more. The fuel economy is a plus, but it's a trade-off. To get that kind of fuel economy, the car has an extra battery behind the back seat. This isn't that big, but Saturn must have thought so because the car doesn't come with a spare tire. It comes with a sealant kit that you use to refill your flat. However, if your tire ever shreds, you're out of luck. It gets us from point A to point B, but the cost of the repairs have left a bad taste in our mouths.",2

I've seen highway trips with mileage close to 35 MPG, but my overall mileage right now is at 26.1 MPG. That's better than some ""full"" hybrid SUVs. Generally, the GL beats the highway mileage but fails to meet city mileage rating, especially in stop-and-go traffic. If that's what you're looking for, the GL will dissapoint.

In addition it only gets 22 miles per gallon -- pretty bad for a hybrid.  I think the poor gas mileage and the problematic engine/electrical system must be related but the service department denies that there is a problem.

The Vue delivers a good comfortable ride but you had best know what your giving up performance wise. It does travel well on the flat and narrow and the mileage which is one of the main reasons we purchased the Green is about what we expected, 25 around town and we have gotten 30 on the highway.

The only real issues that bother me is that there is a draft of cold air on my knees in very cold weather, I don't think the heat from the floor vents is adequate. There is not enough storage for odds and ends or cds. There is also the smell of exhaust from others cars when I have the air conditioner on and outside air is turned off...very annoying! There is also a very bad, sour smell when ventilation through air vents is on. I have never experienced this with any other vehicle I have owned. Maybe the filters need changing.....I notice it especially when the vents are being used when it rains heavily or the car is washed. I have learned to turn off the fan that pulls the air through at those times so I rarely get it but I think I need to change the filters and see if that puts an end to that bad smell. the most important thing to me is that this vehicle has been very reliable mechanically overall.

I have the base model with the CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). I have the leather/heat package, which means I have leather topped seats, heated front seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, and the leather topped dash area. My Vue is now 16 years old, and after all the living we've done in it the leather is kind of ratty. The dash, surprisingly, has held up the best, along with the back seat. The two front seats and the steering wheel cracked and peeled, but I also was not truly vigilant about using the leather conditioner after my initial supply ran out. LOL. The ""entertainment"" package in my car has a tape player believe it or not, but it has a CD player as well. I've never had a bit of trouble out of the players, and the AM/FM radio is pretty standard stuff. OnStar, bluetooth, navigation devices, etc. were still pipe dreams when my car was new. As far as my ownership eperience, I have to say I love my car. It is plenty powerful to get me where I need to go, and I've taken it to the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee with no trouble climbing the inclined roads. We took it on a road trip once where we literally drove 27 hours straight with just stops to hit the drive through and get more gas and it was right there chugging along faithfully. We have exposed it to salt air many, many times and it's never shown any damage to the finish or the performance. It has only gone into the shop for minor issues, though now at 13 years old I need to replace the universal joints on the front axle on both sides. I cannot say too much about how much I love my car. It has been 100% reliable for 13 years of pretty much daily driving, safely transporting me & my family from the beginning when it was purchased specifically because we had a preemie newborn with tons of medical stuff to be lugged around, to now when that boy is a big, active teenager with all of his ""gear"" needing transportation.

Bought it at 171k, it ran perfectly and shifted smooth. Ended up replacing all the suspension over the course of a year, rode and felt like a new car. The Vue was always lacking in power, don't expect to be racing around. 1st gear has tons of torque, a ridiculous amount really. Super easy to spin the tires, and you can get up to maybe 15 mph if you're pushing it before having to shift. Highway driving is annoying, car hovers around 3500 rpm cruising at 70 mph. Insurance is very expensive as well. If you can look past that though, it really is a great car. Only major repair was the alternator around 190k (which subsequently fried the battery), mechanic said it looked like the original. The trans is still going strong to this day, same with the engine. Starts every time, even during the winter when we had easy -20f one year. But. Ever since hitting 220k, the radiator fan went, o2 sensor has been on the fritz for quite some time, and most recently, the shift cables snapped. Parts for this car are ridiculous, I work at an automotive store and the fiancee works at a repair shop, and still repairs have been expensive. For a little saturn, this should not be so.

They cost more to rebuild than to replace, and the cost of to replace the transmission is about $5000 all said and done. Unbelievable!

We bought this to replace our gas guzzling Crown Vic, and we have loved it ever since. Our model is a standard transmission, so I find it is actually quite peppy for a 4 cylinder. It doesn't really ride that well, but you can't beat that the car as 145,000 miles and it's still going strong. I also find that the fuel economy is great, usually a typical 27 MPG combined. A standard changes everything about a car, so when people say the 4 cylinder (which is NOT a V4...those don't exist) is sluggish, you can guess that theirs is an automatic.

It's my belief that the 4cyl VUE is severely underpowered, and the transmission was a failed experiment.

We spent over 26K and expected a worthwhile, safe, economical vehicle. After taking the car into the 2 separate Saturn dealerships for engine noise, hesitation, poor mpg, etc.. while under warranty nothing could be found. Now, we are told the brake caliper is shot as well as the torque converter- over $2000 in repairs and Saturn wants us to foot the bill for at least parts. We are battling it out with the Saturn Corporate- they are not so customer friendly when you have problems with your vehicle. Right now, we are just glad the brakes did not complelety fail with our 2 year old in the car! We should have spent a few more dollars on an X5.",2

We have taken it in countless times for poor mileage, hesitation, etc. Now at 45000 the wheel bearings have gone. If the service department was at all helpful - at any Saturn Dealership we have been to - it would have been a more bearable experience. However, we recieve no solutions to our problems and Saturn will not pay for the wheel bearings either - surely this was part of some of our earlier problems. Also, this car is noisy.. despite it's hefty original purchase price of over $26K - we would have gotten a whole lot more out of our money if we had spent a few more thousand on a BMW or Mercedes in the same class.

Things I like include the following:  Honda V6, polymer panels, ease of cleanup and looks, 360 view, and the overall driving experience.  The thing I like, by far though, is the Saturn buying experience.  It is as good, if not better, than any available - including BMW, Jaguar, Cadillac, (as I have purchased new vehicles from each).  The one item I wish could be changed is the automatic transmission shift points.  In comparison to the BMW X5, it revs further in first gear (3300 rpm vs 2800 rpm for same takeoff speed) and shifts to a lower rpm faster than the X5.  Also don't like the cheap windshield wipers and extra road noise.  Otherwise, it's wonderful!",4.625

I love the way the VUE looks, however I feel it's cheap inside. I find it dumb that there is no switch for the rear passenger to roll down the window!  So if they want the window down they have to ask me. What was the point of window locks? The steering also has a lot of play in it, but overall I like it and would suggest it.

The new ebony interior really enhances the interior, and the white (black at night) guages really add to the package.

The advice I would give potential buyers is to watch out for the upgrades that you can do yourself.  I know hardly anything about cars and I was able to install mudflaps and the bumper protection by purchasing the parts online.  The luggage bars on the room does add to the road noise, but I can tolerate it.  In my opinion this is the best small SUV on the market and I test drove them all.

But, the interior is cheap looking. The gas mileage is mediocre (I have been unable to get it past 18 mpg under any circumstance). My biggest complaint is being stonewalled by Saturn for their reneging on a commitment made to me when I bought the vehicle. When I made the purchase, I requested a privacy panel option.

I like the gas mileage as it's not much different from my car. I also like the roomy interior and the coziness of it. Of particular satisfaction for me is the reclinable rear seats, the grocery rack in the back and the window controls. ",4.125

Mini Cooper didn't have much cargo room and was a little more than we were looking to spend; Scion was great with fuel mileage and price but lacked cruise control and had a weak engine and not as much cargo as the VUE.  The VUE answered all of our questions and met all our criteria for a new car:  price, fuel economy, reliability, cargo space, striking visually.  Friendly, knowledgeable, non-pushy salespeople was a definite bonus.  Great car buying experience.  ",4.5

I get 22-25 mpg, much improved from my AWD mini-van that I traded.  The tank is small, holds 16 gallons, but with the improved mileage, I don't have to fill anymore than before.  Buying it was a dream, easy and simple. It has enough room for my 3 kids and all their stuff too.  With the VTI 4 cyl. engine I have as much speed up the hills as a 6 cyl.

I am the type of driver that doesn't need to show much power when driving, but when in need I press for power, and this one delivers.     Hopefully people will start looking at the VUE's as the best value and economy. When now a days the gasoline prizes are higher everyday.

Just try pushing on any of the outside body cladding to see what I mean. The CVT transmission has gotten louder and louder as the mileage has gone up. The official response from Saturn is that this is normal operational noise but it didn't sound that way when I bought it.  The hood cable has stretched 3 times now. The last time they told me it was fine was right before my warranty went up and now guess what. I can't open my hood.

Jerky, shifts to much, and passing gear puts the rpm through the roof, even when you just ease the throttle when passing.

It defiantly is not sluggish espesially from a stand still. Its gas mileage is better than expected at 26 miles per gallon city/freeway. We are past owners of Cadillacs. Mama has not had to give up any luxuries. In fact some of it's standard features are options on other sub-compact crossovers you have to pay extra for.

The ride is very assuring, plenty of power for passing and hills. The interior is very classy. And I really like the curves of the body shape.  My one reservation is the seating. I am a large guy, and the seats are uncomfortable after just a few minutes. The seat hinge and the hanger that the seat cushion support hangs off of cause a degee of discomfort.

Availability and pricing of parts on line is good, this model is very common overseas and it is not difficult to source O.E.M, German made parts. Quality, fit and finish is outstanding for a car in this class. The construction is solid and the standard equipment compares favorably to new cars, with the exception of technology. It does have a factory, in-dash 6 CD changer which reads Mp3 audio files and boasts 7 speakers, along with steering wheel audio controls along with an adequate driver information system. I sourced a 7"" touch screen replacement unit that was designed specifically for the Opel Astra H/Vauxhall Zafira, this models European counterpart and integrates USB, WiFi, Bluetooth, Navigation, DVD, and Backup Camera. I also replaced the antenna with a modern shark fin style, and my Saturn Astra lacks little or nothing compared with current models in its class, and the styling is upscale and among the best. It could be mistaken for what it actually is, a European import. Economy with the 4spd Automatic is fair, with highway mileage of 32-33 mpg. Available power is good, while the 1.8l is slow to accelerate from a stop, passing power is excellent and the Aisin Japanese automatic performs very well, readily selecting the appropriate gear. A 6+ spd automatic might achieve more low end torque and better economy but at just 2800lbs the car is very responsive once you are underway and performance is adequate. Safety features are good with front and rear side curtain airbags, abs, traction control and a winter driving mode. This model was affected by the widespread Takata airbag recall and my airbag was replaced free of charge at a local Chevrolet Dealer. The suspension is solid and firm, but not harsh with sports-car handling and grip and a European feel. If you would like to stand out from the crowd and get great value for the money in the used car marketplace, I would recommend giving the Astra your full consideration.",4

Electronic, sensors, serpentine failure, ECT.   Over 4000$ in maintenance costs.  So your left with this delema, do you keep it cause it is only worth 3800$ or do you cut your losses on a car with 78k miles.  Stay away from Saturn....never again. Update: Replaced AC pump twice.

I figured a small car would pay for itself and it almost did.   I drove a few small GM cars as a kid in the late 80s and loved them (i.e. the Olds Cutlass Calais w/Quad-4 was a favorite).  I also shopped the Mazda 3, but the Saturn Astra was more the price point I was looking for at the time ~ $16,000 for the XR-3 w/Manual.  New, it drove pretty well, but at around 10k miles it seemed to loosen up and drive even better.  I have had no mechanical issues except one - which was my partially my fault for not checking the spark plugs.  I was heading home from out of town when the car started missing.  I assumed it was bad gas, and since it was Friday evening, I added some fuel treatment and kept on driving.  It got worse and worse all the way home, but I made it.  Saturday I found the spark plugs were shot.  GM stuck me with copper core plugs, which I had assumed no modern cars still used.  Since it only had 60k miles on it, I had never checked them.  With the 200 mile drive home on bad plugs, the coil pack went and the so did the catalytic converter (which is built onto the header).  I replaced with platinum plugs and a new coil pack and cat.  I ordered the coil pack from England for $90 vs the US distributors who wanted $400 for the same GM part (NOTE:  always compare prices with the Vauxhall Astra on parts).  The catalytic converter was the same price across the pond, so I bought it from GM locally.   The little red Astra now has over 106k miles on it and only a torn drivers seat to show it.  It has been very reliable and fun all the way.  I plan to keep it another six years (when my kid gets out of college, lol).",5

I've needed O2 senors, breaks, tires, a fuel injection throttle body, a transmission flush, a new valve cover gasket(oil was leaking into the spark plug wells), belts, hoses, batteries (yes I said ""batteries"") and that's only the mechanical problems. While I still enjoy driving the vehicle, I should have stayed away from a brand that imported their vehicles from Belgium. I probably should have purchased a truly domestic vehicle with more miles because it would have been vastly more simple and cheaper to find parts.

In 2008 I got my first car straight off the ship from Belgium with 12 miles on her. Eight years she was reliable and mostly unique. No-one knew anything about this car. The lack of finding parts for it was a huge setback for me. It was made for one year. It had many features that you won't find on the road anywhere else. The acceleration was also tricky. Sometimes it would go other times it would take a minute to hiccup. When it went it went fast. The handling was insane. It would hug every corner so smooth. For eight years maintenance became easier as parts started coming around and being more accessible. The think you need to know. This was my first car. The only car I drove. On a frightfully raining morning last month my car went to the great garage in the sky. I want everyone on this forum to know this car saved my life. The side airbags were amazing. This car took on a full sized F150 and here I sit. The adjuster couldn't believe it and the tow truck driver couldn't believe it. I never had confidence in the safety because it was so small. Do hot under estimate this car. On the other side. Yesterday received a paper saying there's a recall on the airbags for not deploying. Deploying too hard. Or spewing metal fragments when deployed. Keep that in mind. The steering wheel airbag never deployed for me. It probably should have. I had five out of ten deploy. Do not overlooks this gem. It was and always will be my favorite. I miss it!,5

Parts availability is ok, most parts store have most things in stock, but I usually order from rock auto and have them put on. They unfortunately haven't held there value, but that just means you can get a good deal on a used one. I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a car.",5

The sunroof and heated seats were an unexpected bonus for the price. We had the car 1 month when the transmission created a problem and needed to be replaced. I told the dealer that this was unacceptable and I wanted a new car. Without arguement they said ok. I said my wife hated the red and would like a blue one. They said ok.

So unlike other Saturn/Opels the car thankfully wasn't Americanized with things like overly spongy suspensions. So the car is manuverable and a blast to toss around.

Amazing how rare that was a couple of years ago.  It has mostly fulfilled that expectation. (too bad Saturn went out of business 2 months after I bought it). Every drive feels like an event. This is as much about the overall quality of the interior (design, precise assembly & materials: I have leather), well weighted controls, beautifully damped ride and refinement of response than outright power. Actually the car has plenty of power, it just lacks torque below 1500 rpm, so it feels a bit dead until you learn to drive around that.",4.375

On the plus side, I've never had mechanical problems, it has a great sunroof and very responsive steering.  It's a reasonably comfortable ride although you might find it a little cramped.   On the downside, lack of engine power.  I don't think this thing could outrun a slushie truck going up a hill.  The cupholders where you have to dislocate your arm to get your drink, the very tiny side mirrors, and the paint job wore off after only a few months.

I got a 5 speed, fully loaded, every option avail including the sports, handling package with 17's and 45 series tires. I have never been in a car that handles as well as this. Period. I see maybe 1 other Astra in a week where I live and I wonder why. At the price I got it for over $6500 off MSRP. I stole it off the lot! A premium European 5 door hatch at its finest.",4.625

The incentives made me take a second look, and I am glad I did. Although the HP ratings are lower, the power is spread out over the rpm range and doesn't feel slow at all. Brakes are powerful, and very stable handling on all surface types. It is evident that the car is built by Opel in Europe as the fit and finish is better than my wifes Mexican assembled Saturn Vue.

The solid fit and finish, and classy interior rival my co-worker's BMW 5 series. It's quieter than any of the various midsize cars I've rented on trips (I can actually hear the nuances of a jazz CD at 70 mph). And what's more practical than a small hatchback?

Tweak it to get better mileage (28/36), add some engine options, add overdrive, add a auxiliary audio input port, etc. and it will sell (Build it and they will come....remember that GM?).

The daytime lights began blinking around the 90,000 mile mark.  It's annoying, but not worth fixing for $800.

Once I started looking into this Saturn deeper, I found out about its European heritage. The chassis is Opal, and other car companies use it as well. In Germany, it is the Opal Astra, In Sweden, it is the Saab 9-5, in Austraila, it called the Holden Astra, in the UK it's known as the Vauxhall Astra,  And the Buick Excelle XT in China. It's drives and rides like a European car. The ride is well controlled but never harsh; this is due to a very stiff chassis. The handling is excellent, and it feels glued to the road at highway speeds. The fuel mileage isn't what I expected, but I do have a heavy foot. Mine is a 2003 model, and for some strange reason, it doesn't have anti-lock brakes. But other than that, I have enjoyed driving this car.

The car ran like that for over a year with us just keeping track of milage for gas getting around 350 miles per tank (its about a 12 gallon tank) after a little over a year the car started acting up more and then eventually had a mind of its own when it came to starting and multiple dash lights coming on but not reading on computer scans.

And as far as performance goes it gets up and goes when I need it to. I took it on a trip from Oklahoma to Washington State and the gas mileage was great. Didn't have to fill up very often which was nice at the time. I would suggest this car to others in a heartbeat.,4.75

With my settlement money, I wanted to buy myself a decent commuter vehicle, as I have a 40 minute drive to and from work, pay off some graduate tuition, as well as buy my girlfriend a reliable vehicle to keep her from having to walk to work in a sketchy part of our city. A 2003 Saturn LW300 showed up on Craigslist one day with 80,000 miles and for $3250. I swallowed my pride and went ahead and bought it, as technically it was what I was looking for at the price and mileage I wanted; it's just not exactly what I envisioned myself cruising around in. 2 years later and I am still glad I purchased this vehicle. It has been very reliable, has required minimal maintenance, and I have definitely put the highway mileage on it. I have a few complaints, but nothing major. 1- Due to what I believe is the weight-to-length ratio of the car, it does not handle wet road conditions well AT ALL. 2- the transmission is a sealed one, so you can't easily check the fluid levels; I do not trust this system. 3- Occasionally, an idiot light comes on and the transmission shifts hard. It has been doing this occasionally for some time and turning the car off and back on again intermittently fixes it; I believe it is a problem with a sensor, but nothing I have stressed, as the tranny shifts fine 95% of the time. 4- it uses an oil cartridge in stead of a conventional filter, which makes oil changes a hassle if you do them yourself like I do. Overall, save for that handful of complaints, this vehicle has gotten me to where I need to go, has required very little maintenance, has always been reliable, and that's all I look for in a vehicle. I was able to talk the price down to $2500, I believe, and was thenceforth able to buy my girlfriend an awesome used '90 Ranger that got her reliably to where she had to go, as well as pay off my graduate tuition for that summer.",5

Also the speedometer and odometer stopped working a year ago, and no one can figure out how to fix it.

Had a problem with rack and pinion steering early on.  Had the unit replaced.  That should have not happened.  Some other real minor problems that I would expect with any car.  The stereo system had both the CD and cassette player.  Real forward thinking during this change over period.  I plan to buy another new Saturn this fall.  Maybe the small 4x4.  That would be my third Saturn.  The customer service at Saturn has kept me from exploring Nissan or Toyota.  Hard to walk away from super customer service. ,4.75

This is the very first American- made vehicle I've ever purchased, and am I ever disappointed!! This model has had 3 factory recalls, for starters. My car currently has UNDER 50, 000 miles on it, and it is in the shop getting the timing chain and valves replaced to the tune of about $3K when all is said and done. Watch the air conditioning hoses, the tail and brake light wiring, and check for leaks in the coolant system before you even take Step 1 toward purchasing this vehicle. Buying a Saturn L- Series, let alone any other GM vehicle, is a mistake I will never make again.",2.625

Have had many things go wrong with it. Door handles break. Water leaks. Steering rack needed to be replaced one time and is starting to go again. Key ignition going bad. Had to have a locksmith come out so I could get the key to turn. Need to have it replaced. Some of the examples are minor BUT it seems that more are coming up all the time.

As soon as the warranty ran out (and it was paid off!), the car just started to fall apart.  Within 37-40K miles I replaced the oxygen sensor, mass air flow sensor, and the windshield wiper motor.  Now my brake lights don't work when the headlights are on (another $500 to replace both light fixtures - which the dealership said is common on this vehicle).  Then, I had Saturn appraise the car for a trade-in and the steering (another common problem) is going out and will cost $1200 to fix.  What a pile of junk!  I couldn't give this car away!

However, this vehicle has had too many issues, the most disconcerting being: original (Firestone) tires done at 20K mi.; brake rotors replaced at 40K; turn signal switch replaced at 42K; ignition key/security system switch replacement at 48K (took several attempts to diagnose & correct); A/C repaired at 53K; thermostat & oil seal leaks at 54K. Then there's the light bulb thing and intermittent problems in the sound system-- this is a really weird one (only on AM band; usually when moisture is high).

I won't go as far to say it's junk based on my experience with many other vehicles but this is the first one to present me with issues that had me scrambling to study for a degree in engineering. I'll base my opinions on GM in general and I'm sure it applies to any car that is beginning to age from the early 2000's  These cars had an issue with a component called the BCM (body control module). from what I found out it was a soldering issue that caused the problem. When it fails, it will have a whole host of little annoying issues that will begin to plague the vehicle. Flickering lights, alarms going off, no start issues, etc. In my case this seemed like a simple fix but the part costs $200-250 and has to be programmed by the dealer. The BCM communicates with other systems and controls the mileage of the vehicle, together they seem to create a wonderland of amazing problems that no human being should have to deal with when servicing a vehicle. GM's 30 minute ignition relearn procedure is quite amusing when the electronics that seem to control the alarm begin to fail. Another issue with the vehicle was the fuel pump. I was lucky enough to have both issues at the same time. Did the BCM issues cause the pump failure, who knows? I'll just call it ""irony"". All in all, it's not a bad car and I'm sure there are many other vehicles that will serve up as many issues as this one has. Issues that require highly marked up parts and require dealer service programming and labor fees.",3

I have never before owned a car that had so few problems and I still feel confident about driving it after 255,000 happy miles. The Opal chassis gave such a solid feeling every time I got into the car.  The oversize Saab brakes made stopping a very smooth and accurate event.  The car was redirected back to the factory to add power windows and door locks, a spoiler and alloy wheels.  The sales manager called it an L100 special edition, though he admitted no such designation was attached to the car.  I found these additions very welcome.  The L100 in 2002 became my favorite all time car for durability, reliability, and driving enjoyment.  I have owned pricier cars that cost much more to own and operate.

Only repairs in 5 years was the ignition key lock went out ~$400 by AAA in house repair.

I bought the car with 115k miles on it, a year later I'm at 153k miles. The way the engine and transmission hold up and the overall vehicle dynamics and handling around a curve is VERY impressive. I have a friend who owns a 08 Malibu with the same V6  and the vehicle just doesn't seem as well put together. The handling is almost laughable too. My aura gets looks and people cant believe someone who looks my age (16 when I bought it currently 17 almost 18) owns a vehicle this nice. I have some things I hate about it. It has NEVER left me stranded. Its always been able to get out of its own way. My MPG instant doing 40-65 is between 28-32 MPG. If I baby the gas over a 20 mile drive thee average MPG is around 29 MPG. for car with over 200 horse power and torque, and be able to achieve four cylinder gas mileage is amazing. If you dont know your GM vehicles and what to look out for and what is the best product over all then this car will more than likely keep money in your wallet and put a smile on your face.",5

Aesthetically, it is very nice-looking and since Saturn no longer makes these, most people don't know what it is and have even confused it as a BMW.  Inside are sooo many amenities that I would not be able to afford on a newer car.

Because it's so uncomfortable, it's also very unsafe.

I get compliments on the looks of the car (one lady thought it was a Lincoln MKS). The interior still baffles me. For the most part, it's quiet and comfortable, but the plastics are a bit cheap. The traction control switch is under the armrest, the heated seat buttons are down low on the side of the seat, and the side mirror switches are too far away. These all need to be re-positioned so they are easier to get to. And who still puts an emergency brake pedal on the floor? I had a bad rattle, which ended up being a bad weld on the sunroof bracket.

Little things I notice like some cheap plastics, and poorly fitting panels in the Aura.  Especially the door panels, and door sills, which get scuffed very easily. Shouldn't have that at this price point.  Seating is not as comfy as the Passat. I'm a taller guy, and trying to get a comfortable driving position has been a challenge.

Great style, profile and roomy interior. To top it all off a V6 getting over 30mpg. Saturn making big mistake not offering 3.5l in 2009 Aura XE. The 3.5l has plenty of power and I have no complaints with the 4 speed automatic transmission. I still can not get over the MPG, a pushrod power plant getting that kind of mileage. Handling is second to none, put all of these factors together and you have one fun sports sedan. You owe it to yourself to at least test drive and you will want one.

People have asked me if it was a Lexus or Acura. The car rides smooth, handles well and is very quiet. The fake wood on the inside makes it look like a luxury car. The car is Red Jewel Tintcoat and it turns heads. The 4-cylinder has enough power merging onto the freeways as long as you turn off the A/C first.

Handling is superb as is braking. Transmission shifts so smoothly (perhaps the computer is smarter than old technology) and the ride is incredibly quiet, probably due to the sheet metal and the construction of the windshield.  Interior is finished so very well although the rough plastic might leave something to be desires. The trunk is huge and the back seat folds down for extra space.

The drive and comfort level is top notch. Quiet, sleek, stylish, and quick to boot. Gas mileage is superb. The only real complaint is on the rear interior design. Very difficult to see out of, especially when backing up. Extreme caution is recommended. Past that, there is a little cubby hole door,  just left of the driver, that already won't close when opened.

Just put a new water pump 2 months ago cost $350 for parts and labor. Live in the Midwest and have not had any rusting what so ever just because I detail the car myself regularly.

I installed a new stereo system and touchscreen unit car don't vibrate on outside near as much as others. No electrical issues what so ever. Car has good power & has amazing passing power especially on highways and extremely good handling and agility which is suprising for being such a cheap car and again being that i have the base model motor & tranny are as solid as the day I got it.

Highway mileage is well over 30 mpg, maybe 36. Mixed mileage is 28 mpg. Plenty of power, average ride for smoothness. Seats are a little narrow on the bottom and I'm not big. Had a few small problems that the dealer promptly fixed. Trunk is a nice size, fits my golf clubs no problem. With power assist seat I wouldn't spend the extra money on full power. Quiet ride. Dealer has no problem finding parts or fixing this car. Warranty is 5 yr 160,000 kilometers on powertrain. So far so good, for the money you won't find anything nicer than a Saturn aura. If you can find one. The Malibu is a better car but too new for my price range. ",5

The Goodyear Eagle LS-2 tires (OEM) handle well enough.  Once accustomed to the Understeer (all FWD's have it, RWD's have Oversteer), winding roads are fun, too.

The 3.5 V6 has yet to leave me wanting for power while maneuvering in traffic, but the smooth 4 speed transmission to which it's attached is not the most willing participant in more enthusiastic driving.  Handles well and rides comfortably.  70-80 mph freeway cruising with 2-3 passengers yields about 27 MPG at the pump, dropping to the lower twenties with more city use.

The Aura was a real step up in size for us at the time as my wife and I were both used to driving compacts.  It was a steal for a one year old car since Saturn was on it's way out, but it's essentially the same as Malibu and therefore parts and service are cheap and easy to come by.  It's now approaching 8 years old and has a bit over 121k miles and we haven't really had to fix anything.  In fact, the only repair (aside from body damage from people running into it) has been a camshaft position sensor that cost us about $40 at Autozone.    The rear door locks don't always open by pushing the button on the door, and the plastic shroud over the radiator makes a little rattling sound when we first start it up, but aside from that, it's been pretty bulletproof as far as reliability is concerned.  The AC is still ice cold, it doesn't leak anything, and aside from the rear door lock, everything works fine.  The car feels as solid as my old Volvo 850.  Our Aura has the Ecotec 4-banger which won't win many races, but it's fine for what we use it for--our daily commutes.  If someone wanted a cheap, reliable car that still feels modern, I would strongly recommend.",5

The only problems I've had are the trunk light has never worked for me. I've checked the bulb and fuses and no go. I've replaced the windshield wiper linkage twice. Not the motor..just the linkage. It's not a very good design I think. A metal ball in a plastic socket that is packed with grease. A rubber boot keeps the grease in but when it wears out it dries out and then the linkage falls off. Need to buy motor and linkage to really fix the problem. Driver's door speaker doesn't always work. Left rear door lock won't lock/unlock with the key fob. Small problems.

Now that these parts have been replaced, it's running like a charm and I couldn't ask for better. Honestly, as with any car, the SC2 will last as long as you're willing to take care of it. My father has gone through 4 Jeeps during the life of my little car, so if the SC2 isn't a hardy car I don't know what is!",5

Thank goodness the key comes out before the car is turned off.  Dome light broke off and hung by wires somehow. Rotors are warped so that stopping from high speeds causes severe shaking.

It had about 150K on it, but the engine had been rebuilt and on my test-drive it seemed steady. Add to that Saturn's good reputation, and I thought it would serve me well.Well, it hasn't been a complete bust; I'm still driving it. But in the last two years, I've had to replace both the fuel pump and the starter, and am now looking at brake and tire work. If I was running it into the ground, it would be one thing, but I have a short commute and do relatively little driving otherwise, so the wear-and-tear factor is minimal.Comfort isn't my biggest concern, but it's worth noting that the SL2 is only average in that regard. Very basic interior, a bit hard for people to get in or out of (especially taller folks) and it's not a smooth ride.That said, a newer model, or maybe one with fewer miles on it, might make for a good around-town car.

When they purchased the car for me it had around 40,000 miles. Cut to today: the car has 248,673 miles and still runs the same as the day I got it. So in 10 years I've owned the car the only major thing that has happened was with the timing chain. It messed up one night and I was left stranded at work. It cost $900 to fix the head of the motor that was cracked when the timing chain jumped time. That was it.Besides regular car maintenance (oil, tires, etc.) I've never had any problems out of it.

I did regular maintenence on the car, like oil changes, changing fuel filters and the like. The only extraordinary thing I had to do was change the water pump.

An individual driving the small, light weight car should have no issues with it however, cram the car with a brady bunch of people and you'll find the engine has no torque to speak of. The acceleration is somewhere between average to good but once you add in the torque issue with a large group of people, the acceleration goes right out the window.

So I think this car is reliable and tough. Acceleration isn't that bad but it is a 4 cyl. At high speeds this car is a little rough riding.

Bad visability, frame gets in way, etc. Get a Honda. Just because it is an economy car doesn't mean that the litte things don't matter.

Mine will burn a bit of oil, like has been noted about these cars, but you just have to top it up.  To jazz up the vehicle a bit, I decided to get some aftermarket wheels and the best tires I could find.  It helped the handling noticably (already pretty good) as well as the look of the car.

Driving in city traffic can be downright hair raising, as the car can barely get out of its own way. Our car has the auto tranny, and running the A/C certainly doesn't help, but pressing the accelerator and getting nothing but more noise from the engine is not acceptable.

I've talked to a lot of satisfied owners and a lot of unhappy owners. Me? I rode the fence until we hit 70,000 miles. Since then, it's a money pit. The transmission slips between idle and go.

The only complaint I have is that the driver's seat is not designed as well ergonomically as I would like, and there is not enough room between my right leg and the center console, so I'm always bumping against it.

I bought it as a cheap car to drive between work and school. I put many miles on it and spent very little money on repairs, maintenance, upkeep and fuel. It was slow, but felt peppy because of the manual 5 speed. Looked cool enough to me then, others may disagree. Burns oil, but that's known for this car (buy cheap oil and change it frequently). I loved the fuel economy. I drove mostly highway, but calculating MPG tank-to-tank, I usually had 38-42 MPG. The steering is crisp and confident.

I bought Satyrn Blue at 167K from a co-worker who bought it new. His son had owned it for a couple of years and had bought a new vehicle. I was given a great deal on it and this was a very reliable car. It came with very complete service records back from 2002 and there were no major mechanical problems. When I bought it, it was definitely used and looked it, although the beautiful blue paint was overall not bad for 15 years, mainly just faded on the roof. It had no working A/C, a common problem in older cars. I had the radiator replaced while I owned it but it had no real problems during the 1.5 years and 40K miles that I drove it. It also served me well on long interstate trips of two-three hours one way, both to the ocean and to the mountains. I used it mainly in one area for food delivery and so I drove a pretty close mix of city and highway driving. I could do 80-85 on the highway for a fairly long time and have no problems with performance. It started leaking oil badly around 200K and now it is in my apartment parking lot, not in driving condition and awaiting execution, i.e., someone towing it away for parts. The right skilled person may be able to repair it and it would still make a nice-looking reliable vehicle for another 100K. for all I know. I since have bought a high-mileage 2005 Pontiac Vibe and now, after about six months of ownership, it has almost hit 300K with the only problem being a replacement of what may have been the original alternator. So I am fortunate to have had two very reliable high-mileage cars in a row. This SL2 was the second Saturn I have owned, the other being another 2002 but an SC Coupe, Satyrn BO (burnt orange), which I bought new in 2002 in what I believe was the last model year for the SC. It unfortunately died a violent death in 2004 but was a great vehicle for the time I owned it. Saturn was a good company and made some very good cars.",4

When the car was paid off, she moved to N.Y. and needed a FWD. She asked us to sell it for her. We liked it so much, we bought it back ourselves! I drive it to work now. It's a great car for commuting. It sips gas. It's fun to drive (at least for me). Very easy to maneuver and park. The air conditioner and heater are efficient and heat or cool the car almost immediately. There's more storage capacity than you would think to look at it, and when the seats are down its an amazingly efficient amount of space. I like the overall lines of the car (this one has a spoiler) and it sure is easy to wash. My husband maintains it religiously and repair bills have been few and reasonable. It has held up very well. The only drawbacks are road noise, and driving in the rain or on rare occasion, ice. It does not do well in those circumstances.

The main thing not to look for is dealer support. GM quit making Saturns several years ago. On 11/11/2016 I had an accident and the car was declared a total loss. I bought it back, repaired it and continue to drive it. I still get 30 or more mpg. I've put two new tires and an alignment on it. I think the alignment it received was not well done.

Add to that a very reliable engine, rust proof exterior and 35 to 40 MPG, and you get a car that makes the drive to work quick, reliable and cheap. It isn't a Honda, it isn't a Porsche and it isn't a Buick. It's a Saturn. And for the money, you can't buy this much fun from any of those brands.",4.5

It also doesn't like hills, which are all over the place here.  But other than that, it has saved me tons of gas money. It's also a real rush, since it feels like I'm racing every time I drive it. I like the lower seats, since I have a very tall boyfriend, though I, being 5'2"", need a little extra cushioning. It's also so reliable/safe to drive.

I hope that whatever they make to replace the S series is as good a car as these. I only have 2 complaints about this car. The seat belts do not retract when you remove them so they end up getting caught in the doors when you try to close them. The windshield wipers on this little car have never really worked well. They clear the windshield everywhere except right in front of the the driver, which is where you need it most, right? So, if those are the only 2 problems, I will continue to drive a Saturn. ",5

Everything that the dealer fixed (battery, wheel cylinders, brakes) had to be repaired again by another mechanic.  At about 75000, the transmission began having problems.  There has never been much power - the ac has to be shut off to get up a hill, the ride is rough, and the interior is extremely loud.

I could always start it--even with a nearly dead battery in an icy Wisconsin winter. It wasn't very sporty, but the steering was responsive and fun. The acceleration with the manual was decent for a small engine and it sipped gas.

Safety is pretty good, 2 of mine were totaled by at-fault drivers in wrecks but nothing came into the interior. The airbags should have deployed but didn't. The car is built solidly under its plastic exterior, its skeleton is built like a drag racer, it's reimbursed by solid steel rodding. Can't bust that.

These are quite possibly the greatest economy cars ever built.  These cars were so far ahead of their time, it's insane.  Back when these cars came out in 1991, GM only had a piece of junk Iron Duke 2.5L 4-cylinder with throttle body injection in their other cars.  Saturn was GM's answer to Honda and Toyota.  The original Saturn(which were actually 100% Saturn and not made of other GM junk parts)  SL's and SC's are just wonderful cars.  They are easily the cheapest cars in the world to buy, maintain, drive and fuel.  The only thing I have ever had to do to these cars is:  You will have to replace a wheel bearing/hub assembly($35 on ebay) at around 135-150K and they will lose the plastic radiators at about 150K($50 on eBay).  Other than that, they are 100% bulletproof reliable.  All mine are 5-speeds.  My 95 SC2 gets 35mpg on the highway.  My 02 SC2 gets 36mpg on the highway and my 02 SC1 gets 40mpg on the highway.

At the time I was in the military, and it was a perfect car for driving back and forth. I have consistantly gotten from 30 to 35 mpg over the past 5.5 years. Never had a mechanical problem with the car at all. It has run smothly and steadily  I have had some issues however. The sunroof has been broken 2 times now.  Easily repairable, but annoying. The door seal glue melts in the heat and leaves black ooze on your hands when touched. The auto trunk latch motor is weak, and works off and on, I had to have the brakes fixed due to some premature wear. Great car for the price.

I saw the car on a television show. When I saw the car I knew that was the one I wanted, no questions asked. I did not even want to look at another car, although my parents wanted to shop around. The look of the car was what drew me in because it is sporty enough for a teenager, but can appeal to all ages. The only problem I had so far was some of the wiring was chewed into by a small rodent of some kind and that had to be repaired, but that was a freak accident not created by the car itself.  Overall being it's my 1st and only car, I have no complaints.  ",4.75

I am speaking of the reliable aspect of the vehicle. My first Saturn (1993) I sold to my sister and she still drives it today with 240K on it. My current Saturn has 220K on it. It runs very well and I have to put nominal money into it- just regular maintenance. There is road noise like wind, tire, and engine however. That I can do without. But, when you drive a honda, it is no different. The only difference is the Saturn is American and is much cheaper to repair.",4
2880, on 06/03/09 13:54 PM (PDT),mike ,1997 Saturn S-Series Sedan SL2 4dr Sedan,Great car, I purchased the car with 129000 miles and a rebuilt title. It had been rear ended and rebuilt. The day after I bought it I drove over 2500 miles to Alaska and did not have a problem. Drove it back to Utah the long way (over 3500 miles) and then to Arizona and never had a problem. I averaged 38- 42 mpg on the long trips and 32 in the city. The car ran great and I never had any problems. After 1 year and 25000 miles I was involved in a front end collision and they totaled it out. I wish I had it back. I have always had issues sitting in cars for long trips but the seats in it fit me well and I was always comfortable.,4.125

Unfortunately time seems to catch up to Saturns with a vengeance.  By 70K miles there were issues with various electrical systems and both the rear power windows and the A/C compressor failed, by 75K miles both rear power windows wouldn't raise anymore, and the engine died at 93500 miles, 2000 miles after the last oil change, because the oil change light didn't come on and the car was running rough.  BEWARE of electrical issues on older Saturns!! Other than that, it was a little workhorse...in performance mode (not standard).",2.625

It is now my dependable, little work car.  Small on the inside for someone 6' or over (I'm 6'4"") but I get 33 mpg+ and my truck only gets 18, so I love it.  For a plastic car, its not bad but it rattles like a can of spray paint.  Put new plugs in when I bought it and the dealership had just replaced the clutch.  Other than that, no problems to report.  I drive it to see my folks and that is a 6 hour drive.  Not a bad car.",3.25

Since I bought it, lets count what has died (considering it had 139k on it but cmon...) oil pressure sensor, shift linkage, water pump, and so much more i don't have room to list. The dealer wants me to buy an entire shift linkage cable set for $300 but the damn cheap plastic piece of crap costs like $.50. All of the parts Ive had to buy are expensive. I don't  think the dealer likes you to fix it because there's no room to do anything and you have to take off half the engine to get to the water pump and oxy sensors. God forbid you fix your own car. Interior is cheaply made, ceiling falls apart to dust when you touch it. poor quality plastic fails.",2.25

Never the less the car has always been a reliable vehicle. Also servicing the car is very cheap, about $22 for an oil change at Firestone.  The only ""major"" problem that I've had with this car was replacing the ignition switch which cost me $120 at the Saturn dealer and it came with a free 2 year warranty. I also replaced the tires due to normal wear and they cost me $250 and they also came with a 3 year warranty. This car is very reliable and very cheap to service or repair (except for the transmission like in all cars!) if the need be.  I highly recommend it. ",4.625

Well...100,000 miles later and all I've done to it is replace the tires, 2 tie rods, and a lot of oil! I still take the car for my long trips because it is ridiculously reliable!

I don't like the new Saturns and only wish I could get another 1997 Saturn brand new again. It gets good gas mileage, looks good (even when it's dirty), & has given her all over the years. I have had no major repairs. If you take care if it, it will take care of you. I will be getting an '09 Toyota in a few days, and topping off the gas tank for the last time tonight made me very sad. She gave her all for 143M miles, and still has more to give to the next owner. My dog will miss sitting in the back window, I am sure.",4.625
2890, on 06/25/08 10:26 AM (PDT),David B ,1997 Saturn S-Series Sedan SL 4dr Sedan,Gold 1997 SL," Most reliable automobile I have ever owned. Great gas mileage, better than 40 miles per gallon highway and 30 around town. Easy to work on for tune ups, oil change, brakes etc. Spark plug wells tend to accumulate dirt so you have to be careful when you change plugs. Fuel filter could have been in a better place, O2 sensor is a piece of cake. Nice smooth 5 speed. Still have the original clutch. Liked it so much a got a second one used same color too.",4.625

We bought a 2005 L300 that has required more maintenance than my SL2. The car is cheap to maintain, requires little maintenance and is good on gas. I have had some BSR's crop up over the years, but they are all fixable for little to no money. The car is fun and sporty, yet still responsible. As the car gets older I am finding that I would prefer to simply restore this car rather than buy another new one. This era of car was Saturn's best in my opinion.",4.5

The day after I drove it off the lot, the car over-heated on my way down the highway. Little did I know at that time, that was just the beginning of my problems. The car overheats in the summer if you sit in traffic too long. The electrical system is a joke, if I use the car lighter, I have to replace a fuse or the car won't turn on. Needless to say, I can't use it. The car is very loud due to cheap parts on the inside. Everything rattles! The material from the ceiling of the car feel off. I have manual windows, and the drivers side broke, it won't roll down or up. The acceleration is terrible. To summarize, it drives like a go-cart. ",1.75
2894, on 01/08/08 11:20 AM (PST),Ferris_Bueller ,1997 Saturn S-Series Sedan SL 4dr Sedan,Excellent Value," We bought this car new nearly 11 years ago. It has exceeded our expectations in many ways. It is simply a reliable, fuel economic vehicle. Very few problems, and we are approaching 188,000 miles, and it still runs well. We also still get about 32 MPG in combined City/Highway driving. The interior space is pretty good for a compact car. It does burn oil, but that is what happens to most cars with so many miles. Our complaints are few: The interior has mostly cheap plastic. It is also a little loud when driving. But these things are hard to avoid for such an inexpensive vehicle.  ",4.875

It's still running fine.The only major thing that I've replaced was the transmission. But with that many miles and the way I drive it, it was meant to go out. ",3.625
2896, on 04/08/07 15:57 PM (PDT),Alpha Phi Altima ,1997 Saturn S-Series Sedan SL1 4dr Sedan,Good Work/Beater/1st car," I got this as my first car in 2004 with 66k miles. I found it to be very reliable, tough and cheap to fix. The problems that came up were due to low quality factory parts(exhaust system crapped out at 67K miles,leaky transmission filter), but replacement parts are very inexpensive. It started every time and never let me down. The fuel range was pretty bad, 150-200 miles most of the time. Saturn definitely builds them right but refinement is another story.   ",2.875
2897, on 04/01/07 15:37 PM (PDT),Jenn ,1997 Saturn S-Series Sedan SL1 4dr Sedan,Not what I expected," Everyone told me Saturn was a great, reliable car. So when I started having problems, I was a bit surprised. The whole dash rattles badly all the time, which gets really annoying. I've had problems with the car overheating over mountain passes and nobody can figure out why. The fuel efficiency is okay, but still not as great as I would like (about 26 mpg city). I took one road trip across state and the starter got too hot and the car wouldn't start. Replacing parts is a nightmare (9 hours to replace the alternator) since everything is compacted and on top of each other. Very slow pick-up (what can you expect with a V-4). Nice starter car, but next time, I'm going with something fun to drive!",3
2898, on 03/29/07 17:10 PM (PDT),Logical-Nonsence ,1997 Saturn S-Series Sedan SL 4dr Sedan,Great Gas Mileage, Pick the Saturn out the impound like most the cars I get. Paid $500 cash. Car in great shape inside and out. Been driving it for 15 months now with no problems. It's agreat car with gas prices going out the roof. I normally dont care for Chevy prouducts but I will say my hat's off to Chevy on this one. I think I'll keep the car for few more months. Being I don't normally keep cars more then 6-7mnths at a time. This one having such good gas mileage made me keep it around!,4.25
2899, on 02/15/07 12:30 PM (PST),SLO ,1997 Saturn S-Series Sedan SL 4dr Sedan,Good used car buy," Bought this car for $1200 off an impound lot. Changed the oil and no problems so far. Plastic panels mean no accumulation of dings, so the car looks a little newer than it is. Decent pull from the motor even with auto trans, but it vibrates like a cement mixer so the car has accumulated an endless supply of rattles and buzzes. Teen drivers have had 2 minor accidents in it and the car came out unscathed. Handling, braking, ride are all very good. Trans upshifts occur too low in RPM and sometimes it is not sure which gear it wants to be in. Driving with the selector switch in 'performance' mode improves this. Outward visibility is excellent.",3.875

I still get 35 mpg and that beats out some of the newer cars on the road which tells me something. If I had taken better care of it when I first got it, it would be the best car ever. The only major work that been done on it was a tranny and that was the shop's fault because when they were fixing the clutch they dropped it and part of it broke other then that just things that wear out over time seals, coolant, and other things that weren never ment to last 10 year. Over all I say if you can find one buy it. I'm thinking about getting the '98 that I saw so I can still have this great car!",4.5

I now get 2 times the fuel economy 29-35 avg mpg depending on how I drive. It hasnt had any issues at all other than an old battery I admittedly killed while watching Pirates of the Caribbean 2. It has plenty of power as a 5 speed, if it was an auto it would probably stink, and I notice a significant diference in performance when I have 2 average sized passengers. Weight seems to be a big deal to it. I think it might be common to have the wheels squeal when under load while turning onto a highway etc. The stock stereo had almost no bass so I added a small sub.",4.625

Her plans changed (nothing to do with the car) I was having trouble with my vehicle at the time so she gave me the Saturn. I'm very grateful of her generosity but as far as the Saturn is concerned I would not purchase a Saturn myself. The car is very noisy and uncomfortable. The tilt wheel on Saturn cars are pretty much worthless the way it tilts. I had water come into the trunk from going thru a car wash. The auto trunk release worked for a very short time. The cruise control will suddenly shut off on its own. The automatic transmission does not shift smoothly. For some reason the ignition seems to stick at times. Wish I had a Toyota,3

I can get to pretty much all the parts and not too many computers so pretty easy to maintain.  I've had to get a new cooling system and the rest is just wear n tear stuff that I was able to replace at home.  The SL2 is surprisingly strong...not fast like a sportscar but seriously more giddyup than you'd expect for a car that still gets 30 mpg, sometimes even 33.

It has a 5-speed manual, A/C, CD player and the delightful Saturn Security System with power door locks.  Right off, I had to replace the alternator, but the rest has been ordinary maintenance.  I was rear-ended by a 4x4 the year before last.  The only damage was a broken tail light.  The 4x4 turned over.  These little cars are built to last.

The 97 has 130K plus miles on it and still runs like a new one. Had some minor problems with the sunroof after the warranty was over, but it was an easy fix and not grossly expensive. No other major repair problems. We just change the oil every 3K miles and keep it tuned up and it treats us great. The seat comfort is not the best, but the Saturn is a great commuter car. We moved from CA to CO and discovered the SL2 does great in the snow and ice.

Very safe and stylish, with low insurance rates. The interior has held up well. As for reliability, I didn't have a care in the world... until the 82,000 mile mark, when the cracked head happened. I have found that this is apparently a common problem for these cars. I wish that Saturn had issued a recall on this vital issue. I suppose that 8 years and 82000 miles of trouble free driving is not bad for $12500, though.

It had regular oil changes and all the suggested work done.  The final straw was the factory alarm system.  The alarm has an ignition lockout so can can not start when broken into.  4 trips to 2 dealers (and $500 in other problems)  could not find and fix the problem.

Well after driving it, I was amazed. I picked up so quick and I could feel the potential for power to be released. So you can guess I have been modding it, and its been taking alot of abuse. I pushed it beyond its redline many times and finally ive had to pay for it. It is now finally burning a tiny bit of oil. Most people have problems with burning oil but me I never had a problem.

First the sunroof, then the A/C, then the starter, then the windshield started leaking, then the rear defrost quit working (among many small and major things). The cost to fix these things were more than the car was worth. Once it was in the shop for 4 months because they couldn't figure out what was wrong! I might have gotten a lemon, but I can't even save up for another car because I am putting too much money into this car to keep it running.",3.5

Of course, I have kept well maintenaced but runs like a trooper. I was broadsided about 4yrs ago by big Chrysler. The policeman & insurance agent both told me the only reason I lived was because of the double steel bars in the door. Still runs great. The clearcoat is starting to peel but the gas mileage is great. I'll drive til it stops.",4.5

For $750, and 187,000 miles, I was VERY skeptical. Not the type of car I would buy, bright red is a little flashy for my 60 yr. old taste.  Then everything started to go. The clutch, alternator, brakes, water pump, ball joints, tie rods,I was beginning to think she was EVIL! Put about $1500 into her and then all of a sudden I had this amazingly reliable, great on gas, goes thru any weather vehicle!  Christine gave me back the joy of driving with her 5 spd pickup and great handling  Sadly, high mileage oil use and 1 bad cylinder has me looking for another vehicle. Even on 3 she has more get up and go than any 4 cylinder car I've had.",4.625

Now about the car it likes to wander on the road sound system stinks ,accelerations is terrible, seats are very very uncomfortable Yet the car was perfectly fine when it was purchased the only good thing about the car is the gas mileage about 27-34 mpg ",1.5

A co-worker sold me her Saturn for $800. Our little car takes everybody where they need to go with ease and efficiency. We have made several long distance trips recently and the car has been reliable, fantastic on gas and comfortable for two adults and two elementary school age kids in the back. Despite the fact that the A/C doesn't work, interior is worn and the shift linkage is held together with tie rods I still prefer to drive it over our newly inherited Yaris. Friends who also recently purchased used Saturns are equally pleased. It's a fun car to drive, good recommendation here!",4.625
2971, on 08/17/08 15:26 PM (PDT),mjw ,1997 Saturn S-Series Coupe SC1 2dr Coupe,Wish they still made this one," I bought this new and have had it 11 years. Apart from interior damage due to careless kids driving it is a great way of getting from A to B. If it were left to me, Saturn would have only improved the interior design and left the model alone. I still get comments about the ""new"" car, as on the outside you'd never guess it was 11 years old. Still gets great mileage, and the only money I've spent on it was for a new gear lever part that snapped apart when going into reverse. Just buy brakes, batteries, and tires, and of course, gas!  As I said, ""wish they still made them.""  ",4.75

This car has been excellent in reliability and the body style is much improved (no pop-up headlights anymore) than the previous SC2 years. Overall a great value for anyone who doesn't mind giving up the plush luxury car for a very reliable, fuel- efficient, decent car.",4
2973, on 02/04/08 08:08 AM (PST),Millefune ,1997 Saturn S-Series Coupe SC2 2dr Coupe,A Fun Commuter," I have owned my 97 SC2 for about a year now, and the overall experience has been positive. With a feather foot on the throttle, I'm getting an combined mileage of 38-42 MPG with 85% highway and 15% city. It's amazing how this car is getting hybrid mileage if driven right. It's also pretty peppy for a car of its age, and it feels really light on turns. Actually, the steering feel and turn-in response is really good. Of course, the suspension could be more sporty, but for stock... it's pretty good. Not too much roll or plow. It feels like a front-wheel- drive Miata sometimes! Of course, this is all relative to a car that was only around $10K-13K when it was new. It's an entertaining econobox!",3.625

Having bought this car at a Goodwill auto auction for about 700 dollars(with about 211k at the time), I'd say i've gotten the value out of this car at least 10-fold. At first I was a bit skeptical, but after a while I fell in love with it...that's right, I fell in love with a Saturn. Oh sure, poke fun. But as far as I'm concered, this is one of those ""too good to be true"" things that actually lives up to its claim. It works fine, and I only take it to the shop for oil changes. It is absolutely the best purchase I've made in a long time.",4.375

This has been an absolutely wonderful vehicle.  Every car has it's problems, but in the 5 years I've owned this car, the only things I've had to have replaced is the alternator and the O2 sensor (these are both unavoidable at some point or another)...OH! and the tires and battery! :)  Other than that, I can honestly say this is the best car I've ever owned.  It's my baby!!",4.875

I bought it used and was really worried, but I have had almost no problems with it. The only things wrong with it were caused my me (like driving through a deep puddle and having my battery die) I drive it through the canyons here. It sticks to the road really good and has some kick when I go uphill-not bad for a 4cyinder. The best part-it that it looks really sporty, but isn't expensive. I had one guy call me ""Ms. Money bags"". I beg to differ...:)The car is awesome. My only concern is-it may not be the best car if you are tall-the rearview mirror can block your vision. Watch out for that..",4.25
2978, on 05/16/05 16:21 PM (PDT),Jess* ,1997 Saturn S-Series Coupe SC2 2dr Coupe,I LOVE MY SATURN," I bought my used '97 Saturn SC2 in 2003 as my first car at a Mazda Dealership. I would have to say this is the most reliable car.  It gets great gas mileage, and is very safe in accidents. I can say this because 2 years ago I was rear-ended. Not a dent on my bumper but a few scratches. The other car who hit me had his whole front end pushed in and had to have it towed. In April 2005 just a few weeks ago I had gotten into another accident where i was hit on the drivers side at a speed of 40mph, and I wasnt hurt at all. Of course my car was pretty screwed up on the side but it didn't destroy or total my car, and I was able to drive it to the body shop.",4.625

It was not the most comfy of cars.,4.125

The major problems were the alternator going out at 65k, and having my front rotors ground every 12k. Other than that I have had good luck with the car and it's really easy to work on. I am also running Amzoil so I change my oil once a year which is great.",3.875

This is my second one - I flipped the first one 2X and walked away w/ broken nail and bruised knee.  Bought another, immediately.  I'm the original owner, 8+ years.  No actual mechanical problems (besides sunroof), just normal wear and that's been rare - electronic fuel pump is the only part replaced thus far.  Drives well in all conditions.  Back seats too small for adults, but fine for kids and carseats.  Sunroof no longer working - something w/ cables, fixed it, broke again, left it closed.  Power window motor beginning to slow down after 8 years.  Wish I could ""save"" it for my 3 y/o to drive in 13 years!  Safe & reliable.",4.625

My SC2 gets about 28-30 MPG in the city, and nearly 38 on the highway, so I can always expect to get 300 miles at least out of my 10 gallon tank.

Fun to drive after adding a few performance modifications. Handles well through corners. It was a good experience, but I would not buy another. I had to replace the starter, fuel pump, alternator, sun roof module, driver side door regulator, radiator, water pump and battery. It was practically new again at 105K miles.

Sits low like a sports car, so access by grandparents is a bit difficult. The only problem has been the seat belts don't fully retract as they should, but that is minor.

Peppy is a good way to descibe the power, nt fast but not slow either, it's fast enough.  I think it looks great, I think it's LOOKS alot faster than it IS.

I bought my SL2 with 103K miles 3.5 years ago and now it has 231K.  It still runs perfectly and think it should hit 300K miles.  I was skeptical buying the car because of height (I'm 6'2"") and size of the car.  Not an issue at all.  Not much off the line acceleration but lots of power for highway driving.  I really love my Saturn.  Cost of ownership is very low.  The parts are cheap and lots of resources online for the doit youselfer( did all the repairs myself).

It fits me like a glove. The gas mileage has always been close, or above 40 MPG. The car is spoiled. It has all proper maintenance performed, and the car looks great inside and out. The paint has started to fade only on the rear spoiler. I am thinking of having that touched up. I do have the sunroof option, and the drains need to be cleaned once a year so they do not clog and cause leaking. I have had to replace the speakers, one power window motor, and the alternator all after the 10 year mark. When it came time to make the repairs I really did not feel bad because the car never gave me any trouble before.",5

And aside from the usual parts replacements you'd expect to have as your car ages (brake pads, battery, shocks & struts, spark plugs and, of course, tires), it has never had a major mechanical failure.As far as I'm concerned, the 1999-2002 Saturn SL1 and SL2 were the best-quality cars that Saturn's Spring Hill, Tennessee plant ever produced.",4.5

Only after all these years is it starting to show some issues.  Most of my issues probably are because of the recommended services at 60,000 Miles have yet to be performed while I'm at 72,000 miles.  If I were planning on keeping it I'd surely do this.  I settled for the extreme basic SL2 model w/o any of the extras.  Not even a CD player.  I love the car for the daily commute to work and since I have the 5 speed manual transmission it has enough pep when I need it too.

In that time the only major breakdown was a pin in the transmission came lose and caused a bad leak at around 110K. Since then the alternator (at 230K) oil, breaks and tires, it is by far the best car Ive ever owned.

It's a great little car, and while it's not flashy and it doesn't have a big engine, it gets me where I want to go and it's fairly comfortable. It's very reliable and I get about 380 miles on one tank of gas. I was rearended last month while driving my Saturn, and a Honda Accord was the car that hit me. The front end of the Accord was bashed in and the hood crumpled, but the only damage I had was a small scratch in the paint on my bumper. Shows that I've got an awesome little car here!

It remains as reliable as the day I bought it. No mechanical problems ever with this car. The only thing it requires is an extra quart of high mileage oil between every oil change. It has been in two very minor accidents and keeps on going. I have saved a great deal of money by owning this car. The gas mileage has remained great with 40+ on the highway and 35 in the city. I have 181,000 miles and am confident it will make it to 200,000 + before there is a problem.",4

I am happy to say that I got what I was looking for. It has been reliable and gets GREAT gas mileage. When I bought it, it had 80K miles, had poor acceleration and  used about one quart of oil every 1000 miles. Then the SRS light came on. I had to replace the catalytic convertor. I also did a top end cleaning (injectors, intake, valves) before replacing the exhaust. What a difference!

Now uses about 1qt/1500 miles.  Was told that it was a problem with the rings common in 97- 99 Saturns.  It has been very reliable with no unscheduled maintanence.  It now has about 121k miles.  Fuel mileage started out great, but has declined to an average of about 30 mpg mixed city/hwy.  The servo for the remote trunk release quit at about 105k miles.  Many common parts, like spark plugs and wires, are only available thru a Saturn dealer, and you will pay a premium for them.

On two separate trips to NY from OH we averaged 46 mpg on the freeway.  I will admit that my driving habits do tend to support high mileage.  Has been perfectly reliable.  Does burn a bit of oil, 1 qt every 1500 miles or so, but the engine runs strong.  Not the most comfortable seats during long trips.  Handles and rides okay, will be better with different tires.

It does use a bit more oil now, but that's normal for a car of its age. Gas mileage remains superb; I often get 40 mpg on the highway and recently got as much as 34 while city driving. Little things have broken over the years (rear window and moonroof motors, the radio power knob broke off and last month, the trip odometer knob broke) but the car itself still purrs along almost like new.

I talked him into getting another car about six months ago since I was worried about the reliability of any car with well over 130Kmiles. I've been using it as a second car and I'll have to admit that I was wrong. It has been extremely reliable with nothing done to it but normal maintenance. I recently took it on a 400 mile trip and averaged 38mpg at 70mph. In my opinion it should have no problem making it to 200Kmiles. Even if it doesn't, it has served us well. At nearly 140Kmiles, it uses about a quart of oil between changes, but I'm not complaining about that. ",4.125

First, it makes an awful rumbling and vibrating when it idles, especially when it's cold. Apparently this is normal for Saturns and there's nothing they could do. Then, due to shoddy design the interior plastic panel under my steering wheel just fell off one day.  My spark plugs, brakes, rotors, air conditioner, and now heat sensor on the engine all had to be replaced before 100,000mi and it hasn't been reliable on starting at all!

The trunk will hold absolutely nothing. I feel as if I am sitting on the ground. I paid extra for leather but it is cheap leather and has not held up well with only me driving it.  My sunroof leaks, my driver's door leaks, the ABS which I paid extra for went out 5 years later and the cost quoted me by Saturn to repair was very high.

It has been an excellent little car for the price. Great MPG, tight handling, and efficient mechanical design make up for the notable lack of horsepower. I drove the car almost weekly back/forth from Birmingham to New Orleans for a year, and even after Hurricane Katrina the SL1 never let me down. Alas, yesterday when getting a routine oil change, a certain ""service center"" drained my transmission fluid and failed to refill it (not Saturn's fault), so I must bid my old friend adieu. Obviously, I won't be getting my future car ""serviced"" there anymore but I wouldn't be surprised if my future car is another Saturn.",4.125

The plastic body panels means it survives parking lots without dings. It's insurance rates are low, and it greats good fuel economy, yet performance is good.  It's reliable and seems rugged, but it excites no one.    The best description I have ever heard for Saturns is that they are perfect cars for people who don't care about cars.  The choice of plastics in the interior results in a low-priced look and feel with buzzes, rattles. ",3.875
3100, on 03/16/02 01:03 AM (PST),carshoppin ,1999 Saturn S-Series Wagon SW2 4dr Wagon,SWs way better than LW's!," LOVE this car. Fondly referred to as our ""mighty 4-cylinder."" This has get-up and go when we need it.    Comfy to drive cross-country and with great mpg.  Had it outfitted with hitch to pull small uhaul(4x8) trailer.  Anything bigger greatly affects handling.  Don't ever slide into a rubber-necking a Ford Expedition on an icy hill though, as the higher bumper literally peels the hood up into a crumpled heap even when impact isn't enough to set off air bags. For this reason it's rated a ""10"" by insurance co.s (the lower the #-cheaper ins).  Traction control great.  These saturns are prone to top motor mount failure which causes cabin vibration at idle.  (cost to fix-$150.)",3.75

It's a good little car, and hopefully will get me through a rough patch in my life.However, in approximately 1 out of every 5 starts, it won't. It behaves as if the battery is dead. The dealer I bought it from has replaced the battery, as well as the starter, and the problem remains. He did this on the advice of two auto technicians, and it was tested prior to doing so.I didn't have this issue on my 2003 L200, which was totaled in an accident in February :( I have the owners manual out in my front seat, and am doing what it tells me to do when I start it and when I park it.Any ideas?

I have literally driven this car across the country and back, in the summer and winter, through mountains and desert and never had a problem. This car has been my baby and I've taken very good care of it. At around 125,000 miles I had the brakes replaced, and about 1000 miles later had to replace the heater core and thermostat. It has about 130,000 miles on it now and it needs a new front wheel bearing. The engine, transmission, clutch and exhaust have never given me any problems and still have no signs of wearing out. This has been a fun but reliable car for me, and I'll miss driving it.",4.375

All true. Low cost car that lasted 10 years well. Body stills looks stylish and paint looks good. Repairs were genenerally the normal wear and tear, excepting 2 components. 1) the front license plate holder would constantly be knocked off by even the slightest tap of someone parking in a major metropolitan area.  I had to have the dealership reattach it 5x before I finally convinced that that the clips were a poor design. 2) the slightest barometric change leads to the engine light going on.

I've been driving it for 4 years and love the 38mpg economy. Maintenance costs are average for Vermont with our horrible roads. So far so good with no engine work or transmission costs.

It had 12000 miles on it and only repair I've had to have had done was a new transmission.  Ever since then this car has been there for me at any time! Mileage is great and the third door is great for getting my infants seat in and out without much difficulty at all. Repairs are affordable for the vehicle too! Only problem I can really find with this car is the shape of the backseats. They aren't the most comfortable.,4.25

This reduced the mileage a little bit, but living in a city, I routinely get about 25 MPG. Only things I ever had replaced were a falty crank rotation sensor at 30K which only cost $50, and the radiator went at 85K, which cost $400. Other than that, the AC light doesn't come on anymore. Everything else is in tip top shape and I've never had another problem. It still idles under 1K RPM and I only change the oil. I bought it for $10K in '99 and it has more than paid for itself. I don't think there is an American car more reliable.",4.25

I've wrecked it twice & it still is around for more! I get 34 mpg (my husband gets 37 mpg since he drives like grandpa jones) & the 5- speed manual is very fun. I love all of the features, traction control, cruise, fog lights.  Everyone thinks my car is newer than it is!  It's showing signs of age, though, it creaks & rattles like most old folks & the sunroof brackets have worn out.  But other than normal wear & tear and routine maintenance, I've only had to replace the oxygen sensor since I've owned it. Definitely got my money's worth!",4

Out of all the cars my family has owned over the last 17 years my little saturns have been the cheapest to own. Only problem I've had with my 1999 SC2 is the electric door lock switch broke at around 90,000 miles. After getting a new one for 28 bucks installed the electric door switch now locks and unlocks the doors again. fit and finish and reliability for the price has been better than I expected. Smooth ride for a car this size. Great car would buy another Saturn but don't like the looks of their new models. So I hope this one lasts another 90,000 miles!",5

We have had to replace the air conditioning, motor mount, and engine belt. The sunroof will not work and the driver door hinge broke so it always slams into you while you are trying to get out of the car.  Somehow, the oil magically disappears and the engine burns oil even after cleaning the system. The exhaust needs to be replaced and now the radio dial just happened to fall off. The power window fell off the track and I have so many more complaints!  This car is the biggest headache cheap.  I will never buy a Saturn again. ",2.125

The third door has been a huge help, no more sliding the seats to get out. Being 8 years old it is showing a little wear, the car's interior rattles a bit. The moon roof was so much fun to use, however, now it only opens and doesn't close. (It got a lot of use though) Overall, great car. ",4.25

She had a custom sound system installed and a few other modifications, but most of the car was still stock. It was well taken care of. The only major problem I had was overheating during the summer months. Yet again, it's usually 105º here in Texas during the summer, and any car will have overheating problems when you're having to sit it traffic for over an hour. I've been driving it for about half a year now, and am pretty happy with it. ",4.25

The car is in excellent shape, body is impeccable, mileage was adequate for year, and the motor runs and shifts like silk.  I have no complaint whatsoever about the body style, motor, power, or reliability.  Like one previous reviewer, I also think the hand brake could have been better placed and the shifter is indeed in the wrong spot.  When putting a drink in the forward cup holder, you constantly hit it when shifting.  Other than those two minor flaws, I give this car a huge thumbs up.  It's six years old, looks like it came off the showroom floor, runs like it just came off the assembly line, and I look forward to many more years of fun with it",4.875

The gas mileage is horrible on the SUV and I was tired of it getting wrecked while parked on the streets downtown .  (How can a yellow SUV be hit 3 times? Twice while parked.)  We began looking for a 3rd car ""beater"" to commute in.  $5300 got me a loaded SC2 3 door with every option, new tires, an after market CD player with only 66,000 miles.  The car was covered it scuffs and thanks to the polymer panels every mark came out.  Just minor rock chip touch up and a coat of wax and this car looks like it rolled off the showroom floor.  I've had the car for 5 weeks and it's flawless. I even made room for it in my garage next to my other rides. ",4.125

I like the overall styling on the exterior, the dent-resistant panels and the front-seat interior room.  The performance is pretty good for an economy car.  Cons would have to be the cheap interior parts and the paint on the front bumper and mirrors has chipped very easily.  ",3.5

It has been great with all weather conditions. The only drawback is with the leather seats they are very weather dependent. Yet you will get that with all leather, not just this make. It handles well in all driving conditions: city, mountains, and even back country dirt roads. For anyone who likes an easy to clean car, this is for you! ",4.625

I've had this car for almost 2 years, and I haven't had to replace anything but the battery and the exhaust ( The exhaust wasn't broken, but I decided to hop it up anyways).  I have owned 7 cars, and this one is better than a '99 Civic, '92 Olds, 2001 Focus, or even a '91 Camaro.  This was the smartest car buy I have made yet.  ",4.875

One thing that has been an ongoing ""nag"" ... for about the last year it has had a minor hiccup when running, not really a miss, just not as smooth.  The dealer has run several diagnostics but has found nothing wrong. It's due for a tuneup, and could be that simple (maybe).

I was neither impressed or unimpressed, until the tach hit 4000, and I was hooked. This car is fun to drive. I am currently building this car to race in SCCA solo 2 competition. I love the exterior styling. The interior is simple but not the most sturdy design. The car gets great gas mileage, especially on the highway. Comfort is decent, but my back has started to hurt after a trip of more than five hours. This car has never broken down on me in the time i've owned it. Overall build quality is pretty decent.

I get on average 45 mpg hwy, and 32 mpg city. Small enough that if you need to parallel park you and your friend can lift it into the space (its been done).

For the price, you really can't complain. Gets excellent gas mileage, ABS + Traction control allow the car to handle well in the snow, parts are cheap to replace/repair, and it's a compact, sporty ride. I upgraded the deck and speakers early on (something I highly recommend doing, given the subpar stock unit). Major problems with the car throughout the years related back to the engine - the SL models burn oil like crazy. I've been adding oil every couple of fill ups for at least 6-years.

Very easy to work on too! lots of room in the engine bay. Had to change the motor (might have over rev it.) Great on gas too! I got 36 MPG@70 mph!

Plastic bumpers and dent-resistant sides are great for the teen driver -- I was even hit head on and there's no more than a scratch on the bumper.

We put motor mounts in it (twice) and it didn't help. The interior is cheap and seems flimsy. Lots of squeaks and rattles and it's noisy inside...lots of road and tire noise. The engine is unrefined, buzzy, and noisy. Gas mileage is disappointing. The Saturn tries real hard to be a Honda Civic or Toyota Camry, but falls well short. ",3.125

I just keep putting in regular gas, with that fuel injection cleaner with every other tank, maintain my oil changes regularly, as well as my tires filled properly with air. and this = excellent gas mileage.

It did have a slow oil leak, but with 278k miles, that's nothing. Also one of the head lights was prone to getting water in it during heavy rain. I loved this Saturn and hated to part with it.

This is my second Saturn my first being a 1991 SL2 and have they made a lot of improvements. First the engine noise is down to what it should be for a car like this. Also the road noise is down too. The materials in the car are a lot better quality although I never had a problem or never disliked the first cars interior. Bottom line is I've read a few reviews from people who review cars for a living and some put this car down. I guess it's hard to go from test driving a Porsche 911 to a Saturn. Both Saturns have been cheaper to own than any other car my family has owned. Fun,Cheap to own, and reliable if you take care of it like any car. Take Care!",4.625

Smooth transmission, easy startups even in the coldest of winter, reliable, and very fuel efficient compared to others its size (at least 600km per fill up). Very user friendly dashboard (kind of boring actually), spacious front seats. Lots of cargo space in the trunk.

However, she's lived through two low speed collisions with no body damage, just the hood and plastic bumpers.  Brakes seem to be the most frequent maintnance item and are not as responsive as I'd like them to be.  Great economy car, not the smoothest ride and you can hear outside noise/engine noise inside the car. I bought this when I graduated from college and she has served me well.

Bought off a Ford dealer lot where it was traded in, for $4000. Only 62K miles and looks like brand new. I cruised effortlessly at 80 mph on the interstate to the local Saturn dealer where they gave me a complete service history on the vehicle for free. I was impressed how trouble free these cars are. This car to me has great styling and the dark green with tan color combo with sunroof and alloy wheels really makes the car. Excellent fuel milage with the peppy little 4 banger make the car fun to drive. While a bit snug for a large person (6'3""-220 lbs.) there is ample room.

Going at that speed, I have gone from Morgantown WV to Baltimore MD achieving 32mpg. Between highway and city driving, I usually average at 26mpg. Not bad for an 11 year old V6. It's also very quiet, which is a huge plus for me.What really puts this car head and shoulders above above my previous is the handling. I always feel like I'm in control of the vehicle, even in foul weather. I've been able to take this car into snow storms and pouring rain and still maintain control. While it does take more space to pull a U turn than I'd like, it hasn't been a problem in the field.The interior isn't too special. My car came with cloth seats, a power driver seat, CD player, cassette player, and the premium sound system. The seats are comfortable enough, although the rear seats feel better. The radio console with the CD and cassette player is basic for its day. There is no bluetooth, AUX in jack, or multi-CD functionality. I haven't had any issues with the electronics.My L300 is black with the premium aluminum rims. The look is more class than sport. Although I love the way it looks, the exterior holds my biggest gripe. Because most of the panels are made of plastic, this makes the vehicle aesthetically fragile. Plastic has more give than metal. So, when someone bumps into you, even if it's gentle, you get distortions in the paint from where the plastic flexes. At a distance, you might not notice, but they become obvious as you get closer.The Saturn L300 has been a great car for me. For the price I paid, the value has been amazing. For those who might be on a budget and need a reliable car with great performance, the Saturn L300 is a good choice.",5

It feels great on the road, and was very affordable. Even though I have the 4-cylinder baseline version, I've used this thing for hauling a good amount of stuff, including people that shouldn't have been riding in the back.I do have a few issues with the car, though. The interior materials are a bit cheap. As a result, the seats are a bit uncomfortable and it isn't all that durable.The second issue I have is a big one, writing this review in 2014: repairs are getting to be very expensive for this car. The L-series didn't exactly sell gangbusters, which means parts are getting increasingly hard to find.",3.625
3328, on 04/22/07 11:21 AM (PDT),Curt ,2004 Saturn L300 Wagon 3 4dr Station Wagon (3.0L 6cyl 4A),Luxury Qualities at an Affordable Price," Researched and drove many luxury wagons and found this Saturn wagon. We drove and were sold for our family of four. It has plenty of power and butter-soft leather seats. Very comfortable inside with standard side curtain airbags, big cargo area, plenty of legroom for all, good mileage and 6-speaker crisp-thumping stereo. There's more road noise than in the BMW wagon, but you'll pay dearly for that quiet ride.   According to Saturn rep, the L300's  weren't marketed well and hence poor sales as a result. They were discontinued in 2005 to make way for better selling models. So far we are very happy with this vehicle. Great price, Luxury feel.",5

It was reliable, never had a major repair! But that was all the good I can say. The car had no personality.

It is a sharp looking car that you don't see at every street corner, and the V6 is underrated in its performance--this car goes.  It's a blast to drive and has been completely reliable.  You really can't beat it for the money--with all the incentives, the car was thousands less as equipped than others in its class, and in my opinion far better looking to boot.  Even the mileage is commendable considering the abundant power (we average 24 to 30 mpg).",4.5

It handles well and though it can do better on gas and the comfort for back seat passengers is not all that great I love this car.  I love driving it and it was better than Honda or any mid sized sedan Ford have to offer (in my opinion).  This car is like one of the best kept secrets.

I have kicked myself for not getting the extended warranty for this vehicle. The stereo is the top of the line but the CD changer has a mind of its own.

My son-in-law now owns one and my daughter just bought a Relay.  What can I say, we love them!  And just as important, if not more so - the sales and service department treat me like a consumer rather than a woman.  I got so tired of sales people asking if ""my husband"" needed to be consulted about the purchase of the automobile, or the service department looking at me funny as I described my concern as a series of sounds.

It took 3.25 quarts to bring in to full on the stick and this was the second trip to the dealer for the same problem.  The dealer agrees that it is burning oil badly, but they and Saturn want me to bring it back every 500 miles for an oil consuption test.  I asked why the volume was an issue instead of the problem.

Previously I had a 2001 SC2 model, which I would also rate a 9+ for overall satisfaction.  Our  L300 is never in need of  repair or even adjustment. Pre-service was faultless. The power(V6),transmission 4-speed automatic, handling and braking, traction control, and side curtains make it fun and safe  to drive.
