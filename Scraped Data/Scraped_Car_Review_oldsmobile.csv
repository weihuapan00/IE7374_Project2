0, on 04/26/16 08:25 AM (PDT),Kevin B. ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Discontinued & Even A Better Deal !!!," Yeah, the Olds line was terminated, but under the skin, it is 99% the same as the GM W-Platform line-up, which included the GrandPrix (Pontiac was also terminated) & Buick Century.  Buick is going no where, it is here to stay, and much of the mechanicals are also shared with Chevy cars.  I bought it cheap, $3,600, 8-9 years ago, knowing it sat (only had 36K miles on it) and needed new rotors, pads and some front end parts.  These all use the Buick/GM 3.8 L L36 OHV V6 & 4T65-E 4-speed AOD, which are about bulletproof!  In fact, the Buick 3.8 L, or 3800 Series II, is the lowest warranty claim engine GM ever sold.  Virtually without modification, that block can be turbo-charged, for a reliable 500+hp.  Mine is a basic model, but it is very comfortable, spacious - GOOD transportation.  There aren't a LOT of them out there, and many people have asked me what it was.  Personally, I think the styling of my Intrigue body is elegant, well proportioned and muscular, with bulging fenders.  It was the only W-body car to get the 12"" performance brakes. With good tires (Bridgestone & my FIRST General's, Altimax HP, which are surprisingly good - Thank you TireRack!), the car surprises people with it's very decent handling that would make grandma puke.  Parts?  Mechanical parts will NEVER be a problem, because they are GM parts bin parts, AND, I've gotten any parts I've needed, including grey interior trim parts, window switches, etc., on Ebay, and they were cheap.  Just replaced the CPM, which I bought online, delivered for under $20!  I usually get rid of cars every 8 years or so, but I'm thinking about switching from the 11"" brakes to the 12"" brakes, the parts look pretty cheap.  I think the dual bar front tower brace (originally for the GrandPrix) will fit and look inexpensive, si I'm thinking about putting in that front tower brace.  My wheels need refinishing (ruined at PepBoys when some numb-nuts sprayed brake cleaner on the clearcoat finish), and keeping it.  Took out the sound attenuator from the air-box, I'm going to get a K&N filter, and eventually, I'm going to have a larger diameter exhaust bent up and a more free flowing muffler installed.  The 4T65-E AOD is ar reliable as you can find too, so, this has been and should continue to be a CHEAP, RELIABLE, GOOD LOOKING, DECENT HANDLING car, and the intake and exhaust mods are not expensive, and should boost pep and mileage.  It's no M%, like a friend of mine bought, but he spends $1-2K EVERY time he takes it to his dealer.  I can fix most things in my driveway.  Told I need new brakes, probably $400+ for all 4 wheels, but I bought a kit with good rotors and ceramic composite pads, AND a tool to compress the caliper pads easier, delivered for just under $250.  I know I can swap them in just under 2 hours.  Like I said, GOOD & CHEAP transportation that does not look like 98% of the cars out there!",4
1, on 03/04/16 17:18 PM (PST),Amy ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Keep in mind," Discontinued Parts!! Its is a car that was made from 1998-2002 thats 4 years. If internal parts need replaced, its gonna cost a lot and you need 2 of almost everything e.g. : Timing chain guide's. You wont be able to get those from the Dealership as they are discontinued parts. Thats not a bad thing, it just means there isnt a great demand for those parts so they stopped manufacturing them for the  Dealership. Keep in Mind in those rare instances that you do need to replace them, you'll only find them in a kit, you'll need 2 kits ( 1 for each side of the 3.5 L. DOHC V6) Once its fixed I'm sure it will be a great car.",3
2, on 08/15/15 17:21 PM (PDT),Eva S ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,So far Great reliable car for 7 years, I bought at auction. Had it for 7 years now. Great car as long as you keep it maintained. Very spacious. Traveled alot with it. Good gas mileage. Got way over over my moneys worth.,5
3, on 11/25/13 21:56 PM (PST),xzmr ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,Are you sure this is an Olds?," I am in love with this car. I have the Shortstar 3.5L and it goes fast. I love the way it sounds around 4,000RPM. I love the sound system. Its almost a perfect car. Build quality is eh. But that's what you get when you buy an American car. And the fuel economy isn't where I'd want it to be. I'm averaging 23MPG. 130,000 miles and still running perfect. It's so smooth and refined. It feels like a brand new car. The shifts are so seamless almost like its CVT. The handling is spot on, feels like a European car. But my favorite part, when you're doing about 50 and need to pass, in less than three seconds you're pushing 75. Just downshifts and goes like hell. Really a family car with muscle.",4.5

"," I just bought the car used off a random guy off Craigslist for 1,000 bucks a couple months ago.It has issues of course, most minor, some major for a 14 year old car.Just put another 1,000 into it having the rear strut assemblies replaced, new exhaust system, tie rod, alignment, etc. This is all the major work that needed done. The rest is piddly stuff that any old car would need.So for 2,000 bucks I have a car that drives like a 10,000 car. It's got the 3.5L, with 160,000 miles on it. The engine and transmission shift smooth and quiet. The motor has plenty of passing power. Very impressed with the car overall.",4
5, on 01/07/13 18:44 PM (PST),definingme ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,I love this car!," I bought this car in July of 2012 with 123K miles on her. It's a huge upgrade from my previous cars. She's an old V6, so naturally there are repairs, but she runs beautifully! I love the sound of the engine, and the feel! She is so easy to drive in the Midwestern snow/ice because she's much heavier than my previous cars. Since buying her, I've put on another 10K miles, and I have no regrets! She's reliable, sporty, comfortable, and by far the favorite car I've owned thus far! ",4.5

7, on 06/08/12 20:55 PM (PDT),maani ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,"If I could, I would buy another one!"," As a car for a first time driver, I would give this car a 5 out of 5. It was safe, easy to handle, hard to dent and not embarrassing to be seen driving. My parents purchased this car in 2007 with 69,501 miles for $5000. Standard maintenance was fairly cheap. The only expensive replacement part was the alternator in 2011 at 120,000 miles. Sadly, I no longer drive it due to accident that hit my front driver's side wheel and ruined the driver's side door. The driverwas going 45mph when they hit me and I walked away without a single scratch. I would totally buy another intrigue if I could!",4.375
8, on 06/02/12 12:13 PM (PDT),5yearowner ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,Waste of Money," I purchased my Intrigue in April of 2007 and it was the biggest mistake for me. Yes i was impressed because it had a different engine & a rebuilt tranny, but 8mths later the axle shaft broke inside the tranny and had to repair that for 2500k. Not long after i had to repairthe alternator, the computer system, rack & pinion & bushels, crank shaft sensor, radiator, fuel filter. The head light wiring had a short, so i had to replace that every six months. I also had to replace the ignition switch and a year later the same problem. It would not start for 15 minutes then it would. Finally it needed $2500 of repair. Tie rods, hubs, motor mount. After $5,000 into the car already i said no way.",2.75
9, on 04/03/12 09:11 AM (PDT),meyeste ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,My BLK 199 GLS," I have a 1999 Oldsmobile GLS, I can't say the car is without flaws, but at 171,000k miles it has been a good car. A good friend has been through two Camry's in the time I've had my Intrigue. It has held up well and still gets' 28mpg's hwy and 22 city. The 3.5L engine is still strong, as long as I keep changing the oil I expect it to go 200k. I also love the front seats, they seem to be simply perfect, I have never been uncomfortable in them. It's still a sharp car after all these years, I don't regret buying it.",4.25
10, on 07/23/11 17:32 PM (PDT),olds98 ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GX 4dr Sedan,intrigue," the oldsmobile intrigue is a good car. But it has its downs too. i like this car cause it looks good, it fits 6ft tall adults comfortable in every seat. when someone backed up on me and it was a big jeep and it didnt do anything to my car. and it has lots of power in it, for a big car it tops out at 130 mph. for my car i only had to replace the window motors, blinkers, flywheel, and a oil leak, and thats all. its also good on gas 30 to 35 mpg on highway.",4.25
11, on 03/23/11 19:03 PM (PDT),idiots ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,OldmoJOKE," Whoever came up with the vehicle assembly on this car should be punched square in the pants. No matter what you need to get to on the car, there's something in the way. I have to fix something in it at least every two weeks. The struts have gone out twice since i got it 3 years ago. All in all, I would suggest staying as far away as possible.",2.75
12, on 06/07/10 23:19 PM (PDT),Bill215 ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Best Ever," Bought this former rental with 29,000 on it and have never regretted a minute of ownership.  Repairs have been replacement of turn signal bulbs and driver's side window motor (80,000 mi.) It is a pleasure to drive on highways or twisty back roads. The 3.8 engine is smooth and has never given any trouble.  It's only 195 hp, but always feels stronger.  When it had 80,000 mi. on it, I took it to LA and back (1100+ mi.) and it averaged 31.5 mpg. at Interstate speeds.  Did another 1100 mi. jaunt to AZ five months ago and did almost as well on gas. I've owned them all, foreign and domestic, and this is the best.  GM was nuts to stop production. ",4.75
13, on 05/21/10 07:20 AM (PDT),Joe ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GX 4dr Sedan,My Oldsmobile Intrigue Experience," This car could well be the unsung hero of the Oldsmobile division. I received this car when my grandmother passed away, and so far, it is the best car I have driven. The car has the 3800 Series 2 (L36) engine, with the 4T65E transmission. The engine can be quiet, or aggressive sounding when wanted, the transmission can shift smoother than my dad's Lexus. I was hit at 25 mph by a truck, and the only thing damaged, was a cracked taillight and an inch scratch on the bumper. This car is the safest, most reliable car I have ever driven. Perfect for a teenager. It is a beautiful car. If I had the money, I would buy another one. Just follow the maintenance schedule, and this car will last 200K+ miles",4.5
14, on 04/07/10 10:47 AM (PDT),El Manuel ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,"Mostly great, with a couple issues"," I love this car, I've had it for 8 years and have only had minimum repairs required. One problem is that they seemed to make the power window assemblies poorly. The metal chord attached to a pulley and motor snaps in cold weather. I've replaced 5 in my car. another problem is the vinyl where the passenger airbag is seems to be coming apart. Other than that its a great car. Comfortable, pretty decent gas milage for a 6 cyl, handles very well. If they still made these I'd buy a brand new one. ",5
15, on 03/12/10 06:33 AM (PST),George ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Do not buy!, The plastic trim under the doors holds water and the frame rusts. I probably knocked off ten pounds of rust this past week. I get about 15 mpg in the city and 19 maybe 20 mpg on highway. The crankshaft sensor went out after a month or two after I bought it. Friends who have the same car tell me they have to replace theirs about once a year. They cost around $60 so its not an expensive fix but it adds up year after year. The car just wasn't designed very well. Especially for rust. I can't even jack my car up to change a tire because the frame will bend and crack from all the rust. Do not buy. Spend a little more on a better car. Like a Honda. This car is a waste of money,3.125
16, on 07/23/09 14:51 PM (PDT),Rocketfxr ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,My Favorite Car," I purchased a 1997 Olds Intrigue GL Basic with no bells and whistles back in 1999. It had been a former rental car with 23K miles, so it had been ""well loved"". I put over 120K on it myself. 3 years later I found another 1999 Intrigue GLS with low mileage, Leather interior, Bose Stereo, Power seats. I have put over 100K on this car. I had to replace the engine at and rebuild the transmission at 120K.  It was worth the cost, the car is so nice to drive and it really moves! GM really messed up discontinueing this line.",4.875
17, on 07/12/09 01:39 AM (PDT),Phyllis ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Great Car, We brought this car in August of 2004 because of the price and the financing on it was in our price range. It has been one of the best cars we have ever owned. Very few problems and nothing major has gone wrong with it. It runs great and get great mileage. We are still driving it and still love it. ,5
18, on 05/11/09 20:26 PM (PDT),mboily ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Can' never go wrong with the 3800!," 6 Years and 70,000miles since I bought this 38,000miles used car. First off, I was a young sales rep when I got the car back then and the reason was because it was the only car I've tried under $12K that I felt very comfortable in. I'm 6'4"" and no other car offer this type on leg and head room. I also wanted to another 3800 motor. I didn't have to any troubles with the car, the sterring colomn was the biggest issue I had when I got it at 40Kmiles, it was replace under warranty since then They have made a call back on that issue. I've just changed the rear suspension abd battery. I also had to change one interior fan motor ar 80Kmiles. I had 3 sets of brakes an rotors in total.",3.75
19, on 04/13/09 18:13 PM (PDT),Lyn ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Ten and I still love her!," She has almost 160,000 on her, a few little patches of rust, have had to replace 2 sensors, and have had a few problems..her interior is getting worn, right blinker stops working when ya slam the hood too hard.....but this little car can still go from 0 to 60 in seconds! Everyone laughs until they drive her.  I love this car, it's been faithful, best I have ever owned...and still driving it 9 years later!",4.875
20, on 03/19/09 20:08 PM (PDT),Tropycsman ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GX 4dr Sedan,Old Dependable," I bought this car used as a rental.  I maintain it well.  The mileage has been very punishing city driving 95% of the time.  I average 16mpg city and 27mpg highway.  Other than an issue with the brake proportioning valve, the car has been very dependable.  It is my ""beater"" and keeps on ticking.  The performance aspect has been very surprising.  With the right tires the car handles well in the rain, snow, and, of course, dry conditions.  Acceleration is good with lots of low end torque (3.8L V-6).  Interior is comfortable and roomy but plain.  This car is a keeper.",4
21, on 03/10/09 11:12 AM (PDT),Mike ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,The Oldsmotrigue," Well, it's official now, my car is 10 years Olds!! It has 128000miles on the odometer and the way it feels, it could take another 100000. I have the 3.8 version. I had a buick T-Type before with the same motor and I sold it with 145000miles on it. Since I have it I've had the regular maintenance and parts replace from wear and tear, nothing more. Since i'm young (early 30's) my generation is too familiar with keeping a vehicule or buying American for that matter, I always under pressure to change it for an Europeen model! But since this one is paid for and is running in good order I will keep it and perhaps get a BRAND NEW SPORTS CAR!! (pronouce like Bob Barker would) THE 2010 CHEVY CAMARO!",4
22, on 01/22/09 15:56 PM (PST),biglakemi68 ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,No regrets," I have owned three Cutlasses ('68, '71 and '80), an Alero, an Aurora and a LSS 88 and this has been my favorite Olds. Right now I have 175K on the original motor and tranny and can still pull 100+ mph speeds on closed track. Reliability has been excellent. Repairs have all been within reasonable parameters for a car of its age and mileage. She's starting to show her age cosmetically, but still rides like a dream and runs like a rocket. Love the control placement, cabin ergonomics and handling.",4.5
23, on 01/12/09 06:57 AM (PST),mikey ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,This Car Has Given Me Lots Of Problems," I've had this car since a year ago and when I bought it for $2,000. I thought I was getting a steal. Until I drove it al ot and gave it a good test run. Since I've had it I've had too fix the power steering, the timing belt, crankshaft, and the starter. Now I am currently taking it into the shop to get it looked at because yesterday it just died as I was going down the road and when it happened I lost all of my acceleration and it slowly died in the parking lot, now when I try to start it it sound like the starter is spinning but it's just not catching. This car is great! But it also comes with its grief and you'll spend a good amount of money on it.",4.25
24, on 01/04/09 11:35 AM (PST),Fandor ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Don't Be Fooled," I have owned my iIntrigue since 2001. In 2003 had to have the motor replaced due to some annomoly that was known by GM about the balancer rod in the block. 2008 had to replace the engine again. 2 months after replacing engine, had to replace the transmission. Have had to replace every power window unit in the car and getting ready to replace another one. In cold weather the power fluctuates up and down causing the lights to dim. Heater fan does not work correctly. Power steering has failed, and that is no fun to replace. Two oxygen sensors. This car is the reason that foreign cars are selling so well in America.",3.125
25, on 01/02/09 11:39 AM (PST),Erin ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Wish I didn't have to say goodbye," After 8 years with my Intrigue, I am sad to say goodbye to it, but must due to the increasing repairs I have to make to it. At 40,000 miles, I had sensor issues. At 60,000 miles, I had all hub bearings go out. Now at 130,000 miles I have had alternator, a/c and more sensor issues, a broken fuel gauge, engine mounts replaced, and now a coolant leak that will cost $1000 to fix simply because of the cost of parts for this car and the difficult accessibility to certain areas. I adore the horsepower and performance of the car, but just can't keep up with $4000/year in maintenance costs.  ",3.125
26, on 11/21/08 11:02 AM (PST),johnryan1077 ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,Should have gotten rid of Buick," I have owned my 99 Intrigue for 2 years and it only has 78,000 miles on it and it drives like new. I realize it is going to be 10 years old next year but it drives so well and its looks stood the test of time. I have the 3.5 liter engine and it cooks on the highway. I think GM made a mistake buy getting rid of Oldsmobile instead of Buick. How many ten year old Buicks do you see on the road compared to Alero's and Intrigues. Great vehicle!",4.625
27, on 11/19/08 20:02 PM (PST),Paul ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Five  Years and Still Going Strong!," I bought this car about 5 years ago with 82,000 miles on it and I am still in love with it. I have only had one problem which was the drivers window motor and track broke. Probably because I eat so much fast food and use it way more that average. It is very spacious and comfortable except on long road trips the seats become bricks. It now has 142,000 miles on it and I have had to replace some of the suspension because of normal wear and tear. The engine and transmission have been perfect despite claims at the dealership that the tranny has a bad reputation just to sell me a warranty which I refused. It picks up speed very quickly and has 215 HP whith 3.5L which is much better than the 3.8L!",4.75
28, on 10/04/08 12:54 PM (PDT),Jay ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,I miss my Intrigue.," Best. Car. Ever. I had this car since 03 and it never failed on me. I got 200,000+ miles on this car and it would have been more had I not gotten into an accident. It would have been 10 years old next year and it was still running great. The interior is great and I was glad to drive a car that looked like a car, rather than some boxy car like the Prius or Malibu. Also, another reason why I like this car was because I was able to drive it through the mud (I live in a rural area) and there was nothing like going into town and driving next to a pathetic hummer that never touched dirt -- this is why the Intrigue rules!",4.875
29, on 09/28/08 15:42 PM (PDT),MixedEmotion ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,Keep it for its size," I bought this car 2 yrs used, and it now has almost 160k miles on it.  Before I go negative, this car is a hoot to drive!  It sticks in the curves, and has big mirrors and reasonable acceleration.  80 mph is like standing still.  Mine is on the 2nd engine and 2nd ABS module, the back window machines are busted, and some think it is more trouble than its worth.  This time its a water leak from the intake cover.  I think this year I will have put over $1500 into repairs (including that ABS and break overhaul, and what I expect from this leak).  I may also need a mass air flow sensor.  My mechanic loves to see it coming.",3.375
30, on 08/07/08 10:35 AM (PDT),Blondie ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Intrigue 3.8 6 cylinder," Still driving her after 7 yrs, I bought her with 33,000 miles and she is still running after 137,000. I give her regular oil changes, & normal wear & tear, brakes, rotors, & struts. When she reached 120,000 after her tune up she started to need a little more work done.  In the past year I've replaced the fuel filter, oil pan, battery, both (R)and(L) cv joints. Which I didn't need to replace. I had a clicking noise when I would turned (R) only, so after the 5 mechanic it ended up being my starter, the spring in the starter wasn't sitting right so every time I turned (R) it would hit the fly wheel. I just did my own brakes & rotors this time. So shes ready to go for another 100,000. ",4.5
31, on 08/06/08 07:38 AM (PDT),Ann in Tenn. ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Love it and would buy another!," This has absolutely been the best car I've ever owned!  It now has 221,000 miles and still runs like a new one.  With regular maintenance the 3.5 engine has never given a problem.  The only problem was the fuel pump failed in the 2nd year but warranty covered it.  Like other folks said, GM should have kept making these jewels.  It's fun and sporty to drive for a family car.  I've had the foreign made cars but I'm sticking to American made from now on!!!  ",5
32, on 07/08/08 16:04 PM (PDT),cliftsnew ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GX 4dr Sedan,Dependable Car," I purchased this vehicle July 2004, and it has been a great vehicle. I purchased the vehicle with 73,000 miles on it, and it now has over 170,000 miles on it. The only problems I have had were with the brakes, because of exposure to the elements. Besides this I have had no problems. I use Mobile 1 synthetic oil, so tried to maintain it. Word of advice when you need to replace oxygen sensor do so immediately otherwise you may have to pay in the long run. I did not change mine for almost a year and it made other problems arise, but not till now, so I think this has been a great vehicle. If you find one  used purchase it as soon as possible.",4.125
33, on 06/28/08 02:01 AM (PDT),hr ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Olds but not forgotten, This is a great all around car. It is midsize and not too big or too small. It has split folding rear seats to haul bigger objects. It gets 22 miles per gallon of reg. fuel.,5
34, on 05/29/08 10:53 AM (PDT),Tiffany ,1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GL 4dr Sedan,Good Car Overall," Originally bought the car with 36K on it and now at 170K I can't really complain.  I haven't had anything major wrong with it, just normal maintenance fixes so far.  The one continuous problem that I am having is that the light in the front blinkers keeps going out.  I just quit having it fixed. ",4.875

Handling is sharp and precise, the 3.5 L engine is serious fun to drive. It still gets 28 mpg on the highway. I am still smile every time I get into it and I think that says a lot. It's just too bad GM killed this car & engine. I've had one problem with it; the crank shaft position sensor went out around 60,000 miles, I replaced it for $125, everything else has been regular maintenance.

Overall a very good car. Drive train is great with the Series II V6 and a strong tranny. A lot of electrical problems over the years. The interior has disintegrated and all the plastic stuff is broken. The windshield wipers have been a problem. The A/C crashed after 6 years and was too expensive to fix so we've done without. I feel like I've gotten my money out of it so I'm trading it in. If I found a clean one used, I'd buy it for the kids. ",4.125

Fun to drive, good fuel economy, good ergonomics, comfortable. It always (from around age 2+) had a minor, but irritating, oil leak that no one ever seemed able to find or fix. Otherwise, experienced only the usual and expected wear-related maintenance issues until about age 9, when several major problems cropped up (cracked intake manifold, mainly), and along with expected maintenance items consistent with that age/mileage just became too much to justify on a car with 121K miles. Finally traded it off 8/2008, but with a lot of sadness.  It really was a good car overall, and I was very sorry to see it go.",4.75

It is the earlier model with the 3800 seriesII V6- a great engine and no transmission problems. In fact no major maintaince expense- just what one might expect. Starter, intake manifold, plug wires and hoses. I hope to get another 150000 miles.

I've owned it for less than 4 months and have put 3,000 miles on top of the original 45,000. It's my first car and I can already tell that it was a good choice. The car has enough power and acceleration to keep me entertained without getting me into trouble. In the twisties this car is a blast. It seems to have the perfect balance of handling and ride quality. The car performs on long trips, although the seats can get a little uncomfortable after hours on the road. The brakes are strong and responsive but the stock tires aren't great. The tread life is too short. I already need new tires and they aren't as thick as I would like.

The car is very comfortable, handles well, is fun to drive, seats 5 comfortably, and has been surprisingly reliable. With 115,000 miles on it since purchased in 11/1997, we have had to perform a grand total of 2 (two) repairs other than routine maintenance. The starter had to be replaced at around 60,000 miles and at 110,000, the automatic headlight sensor was replaced.  The fuel-door release button popped off a few years ago and was never found (fortunately I can stick my pinky in and trigger the release), and the electric window control panel on the armrest has been loose almost since new.",4.875

It is a rather large car, but it gets excellent gas mileage.  I averaged low 20s in the city and high 20s on the highway.  I mainly used it for winter, cause its fwd and with snow tires I managed to go everywhere. I replaced the rotors at 164,000 miles.  It needed new belt a little while after that at 189,000 miles. The intake manifold went and it cost $1,500 for new engine, but considering the miles, I sold it to my mechanic. I see that he's been driving it around, so it must be doing good.",4.5

It is clean and good driving once in motion. It has a problem with not going into gear out of park when it is cool until the car is warmed up for at least five to eight minutes. No mater how hard I push that shift button, it won't budge. The dealer says ""I don't know what it can be just bring it in. Right. But the car itself is very likable. It is bright and with good visibility. If it wasn't for the transmission problem (shifter), I'd keep it over my 1995 Cougar, but one has to go and with 127,000 miles the Cougar still purrrs along so Intrigue while it's otherwise a very pleasant car has to go.",3.375

It is one of the very best cars I've ever owned!  It provides an excellent combination of style, comfort, performance, and good gas mileage. Its build quality could have been better (door and hood alignment). One problem I've had (a common one according to my mechanic) is with the plastic intake manifold.  I had to replace it because it had ""bubbles"" between the coolant ports and the air/gas intake (fortunately no leak of coolant into the air/gas intake at the time it was found out which could have been disasterous driving at highway speeds!). I wrote to GM but got no satisfaction! It is really an engineering design flaw! I pop the hood whenever I can now to let out the heat! ",3.625

I had to replace the brakes, tires, steering rack, front hubs, and ball joints. the radiator is next.  My car has 166,000 miles, so I can't complain. I wish the fuel economy was a little better. stereo upgrades were a sinch with the stuff that I got from crutchfield. I would buy another one today if the one that I have died.",4

It was a rental car at one point based on the Carfax report. I just hit 103,000 miles with no significant issues.  All it has needed is new tires, new brakes and a serpentine belt.  The car is bullet proof!  I keep track of mileage and I got 28 MPG in my last fillup in mixed city/hwy driving.  The car's handling is still top notch with over 100,000 miles on the odometer.

I had no problems with it (just normal routine maintenance) until we got over 100,000 miles.  The power windows and windshield wipers have ceased to work. I am an extreme neat freak and wash and detail the car at least once ever two weeks, but the interior leather on the door is beginning to peel off. The cassette player eats any tapes we insert. The CD player, when driving, becomes abnormally hot and the factory speakers have blown. The car has begun to stutter when I hit the gas. We have gone through brakes like a fat kid goes through twinkie boxes. But, we have driven this car over 20,000 miles a year since we bought it.

The sound system is awesome, it has the OEM sound I've heard - and I'm a sound man and electrician. My son is comfortable and safe in this car and that makes the differnce. It also has trunk space for many long trips. It saddens me that GM decided to stop the Oldsmobile line because if they came out with a new Intrigue I would buy it.

143, on 09/16/15 13:17 PM (PDT),BK ,2000 Oldsmobile Intrigue Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,Not the greatest," This was my first car I had at 16 and owned it for 7 years. Bought it used with around 70,000 miles and worked good for the first year or 2. Performance was pretty good for a ""grandma"" car, putting the pedal down going about 30 would still break the tires loose. Understeer was as expected in a front wheel drive but it did well in the winter as long as there wasn't a huge snow storm. There were several things that went bad in the years I had it though. Wheel bearings were terrible. After about 2 years I had to replace the front bearings. Not long after that the rear ones went out. And about 3 years after replacing the rear bearings they went out again. 6 bearings for a car with 4 wheels over about a 5 or 6 year period is ridiculous, I initially blamed my driving thinking I took corners maybe faster than the car was meant for but I have since learned this was a common problem with the vehicle. About 3 years into owning it the electronic control module crapped out and wasn't worth the estimated $1000 for the dealership to fix it so I lived with it. This going out caused the dashboard to look like a christmas tree, no ABS, no traction control, the power steering just felt different but I can't describe the feeling even though it wasn't bad it was just different, the precision control didn't work even though I wasn't sure what that even did so that may be where the power steering felt different, electronics in the cab would do weird things like turn off the cruise control if you roll a window down and things of that nature. The cool thing about the ECM going out was the governor also went with it so one time while passing 4 cars I was able to take it to 126 before I decided it was smart to let off the gas. Passenger rear window went out and the replacement motor only worked for a few months so I believe the ECM going out had something to do with this. One spring the car was idling real low and would die at stop lights and that turned out to be a sensor in the engine. Another time the car idled way too high and I had to shift it into neutral at stop lights while onlookers probably thought I was showing off by revving the engine and then slamming it into gear, that was another sensor issue in the engine. And towards the end of my time with the vehicle it just shifted like crap, hard shifts and had problems finding the right gear to be in. This vehicle was probably my last experience I will ever have with a GM, there was always something wrong with it.",2

The door panels move a little when you touch them and the passenger widow control actually popped out one day when my wife closed the door. The fake wood paneling is cheap and is cracking on the dashboard. The rear power window stopped working and that was only after a handful of times using it. It burns way too much oil.

I bought it and then 3 months later had to replace the engine. 3 months after that had to replace the struts, which by the way cost almost 300 each! Now all the lights are on, on the dash. The signals do not work anymore. And the car started randomly shutting off while you are driving! Most of the time you try to start it and it acts like it has a dead battery. And I have never seen rust problems like this before! This is the worst car ever, will never never never buy a intrigue ever again! Stay away from these cars!",1

It stopped working around 60,000 and I have not tried to fix it, also the a/c heating element is shot so it only blows on the highest setting. The driver door is also causing problems now.

Compared to Accord, Camry, Passat, and Maxima, when I was shopping. Intrigue felt like it was built better, with more quality feel to it. Plus the motor is Northstar inspired, and borrowed from the Aurora. The acceleration and passing ability are far better than the numbers most magazine put out.

The car seemed to always have this issue with the blinker turning right. I was told that it is a sensor and is around 400$ to replace NO THANKS! Common issue with these cars i am told ill go without! Then my car one day decided to start stalling on me in the middle of intersections and when i was driving normally! it was scary trust me but i didn't do anything about it until one day i went to go start it and it wouldn't at all so i jumped it but every time it would bog out after a few minutes! I got so sick of it i let it sit there all winter without even driving it because i didn't want to deal with it! Anyway i took it to a GM dealership and 500$ later with a cam shift sensor and a new battery the car seems great now! Love how it drives and handles curves and the acceleration is great!

This car's understated styling still gets curious onlookers.  Its beefy Goodyear tires, ABS, a smooth transmission are all excellent.  My only gripe is the standard GM penchant for ill fitting dashboard plastics.  I have had no squeaks, rattles, or maintenance issues with my Intrigue.  It has been completely reliable and has plenty of power.  The suspension eats up bumps.  The handling is tight, especially for a deceptively large sedan.

The instrument panels are very basic like just the bare essentials. Radio is different from the other models. its actually different from the one shown in the owners manual. The window clips that hold the window on a non-power window do become very fragile in advanced age. Only 2 major issues that have happened was transmission lines busting and brake lines busted all in spots which were difficult to repair by myself. There is one nagging issue but is very common and that is the security lock out upon start. The other slight issue is simply the road, between noise and comfort of ride. As the driver i have never had an issue with comfort in the front seat. My passengers tell me the front passenger seat is fine but the back feels like you are dragging the road. I would say this could be suspension. However, i replaced the whole nine yards of it, making it brand new parts. One major recommendation with an Alero (and any car for that matter), is to always do the regular maintenance because as it wears out, the way the car runs and rides becomes rough in this car.

I take it back to the dealership for the noise.  They come out and tell me that it's the bearing, alternater, lower intake manifold gasket, both lower control arms, both upper strut mounts.  I was given a rediculous quote to fix it all.  I'm not sure what to do, but I would recommend avoiding picking one of these up.",3.5

452, on 08/17/17 16:04 PM (PDT),Nick ,2004 Oldsmobile Alero Coupe GL2 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 4A),This thing just won't quit," Bought my red 2 door alero for dirt cheap and it had next to nothing for the miles (114,000) for the GM 3.4 that's nothing!! The ride of the vehicle could be better but the handling is fantastic! Acceleration is really good probably because I have the 3.4, sorry for you 4 cyl out there lol. The safety of this car is amazing for such a little car, took a lifted Dodge Ram head on I really thought this car was going to the junkyard but nope I slapped a new hood bumper and fender on and it drove like new! This car does go through brakes pads and rotors pretty often ( replaced 3 times already mileage is only at 145,000) and when they were replaced it still squeaked when drove (annoyed the hell outta me but hey the car still stopped) also the car goes through tires quickly too ( also my 3rd set 30,000 miles) you really need to keep up with the maintenance on this vehicle and she should last you a very long time! My advise to you if you're looking to purchase one is make sure it's been maintained pretty well or it will be a nightmare",4

Don't get me wrong though there are some problems.... I have an 04 red 2 door 3.4l and boy this thing is pretty quick. You put your foot done and it drops down a gear and just takes off. It feels like you are ""floating"" when you drive or get up towards the governed speed of 110 mph. I passed a lot of cars with this alero, including some mustangs and many many hondas. This car has some major head gaskets issues however. I am on my 3rd set now. I have rebuilt this motor myself inside and out. Stock rods and pistons are pretty solid, and the aluminum heads dissipate a lot of heat. This car also has bad tranny problems.. This is my second trans in my alero, they leak tranns fluid really bad. However the engine area is pretty easy to work on, you can pull the whole motor apart in the engine bay and put it back together in 8 hours. Also this car seems to have a problem with staying aligned and it blows through brake rotors, calipers, and brake pads. Even with a good alignment this car goes through tires quick. I am a little rough on the car because I deliver pizza everyday. It is pretty fast though, more lower end power. Stock speakers sound nice, driver seat raises and lowers.",3

Who ever had it before me did not do any preventative care to the car, I had to put a lot of work into it but it was worth it, I have asked all of my friends to keep an eye out for any GLS coupes in the Tri-cities area, and we still have not found one.

The Alero coupe's appearance is classy, yet sporty enough to be an attractive car.  I've owned my Alero for three years, and while it's not an envy-worthy car, I get great gas mileage, and it's been VERY inexpensive to maintain.   I have had ZERO major problems with my car.  I've only had to repair the lifter on the automatic window.  Probably my fault it broke.  I paid $10K for my car when it was a year old, and my payments are very low.

Only have 1 speed on the fan-high, so have to now replace the blower motor and with about 70K miles both rotors are warped and need replaced.  The CD player does not always eject the CD properly.

It wasn't a roomy car. Taller people had a hard time with the leg room and the head room. There was some clinking noise behind the radio, they couldn't figure out. The driver's door window seal  wasn't tight, and would sometimes leak  water when it rained.  In the winter time I had the most problems.The driver's door wouldn't latch tight when  I shut it every time. I would have to spray W-D 40 on it for it to shut properly. The worst part was the brakes. If I hit snow or ice, especially going downhill, there was no stopping the car. The brakes sounded as if they were grinding, bad.

I favor the Alero because it's not a dorky car, and it's not a boring Honda/Toyota.  Its exterior design has a lot of personality and class.  I get a lot of looks of approval in my little gal, and she's as stock as the day I bought her!  So far, I have had ZERO problems with this car.  She is very reliable and so much fun to drive.

All of the motor mounts have been replaced, but it still vibrates like crazy when its in drive and the brake is on. I am afraid it may be the transmission, but at least I get a full-body massage at every stoplight. The interior keeps threatening to fall apart. I keep making small repairs to the brackets that hold the driver's side mirror adjustment and the ash tray beside the steering wheel. The trac-off light is quite a pest though and it [the car] sometimes hesitates or skips when the driver accelerates. Very good handling and pretty decent spunk to the engine.

This car is great in the summer, the AC works like a dream, but in the winter, if there is more than one person in the car, or the heat is on, the windows fog so that you cannot see out of it. I have to roll down the passenger window, thank goodness it's auto, to see into that mirror. Once it starts to fog, you either have to turn off the heat to prevent it, and hence be cold, or turn on defrost all the way. It is so annoying, and dangerous!

Saif ,1999 Oldsmobile Alero Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,Perhaps this Car Could have Saved Oldsmobile," I bought my '99 Oldsmobile Alero GLS in Oct. 2002 as a replacment for my '93 Mercury Tracer LTS. It was a zippy little car, but I wanted something bigger. The car was listed below KBB, fully loaded and was too good to pass up with 82,000 miles on the clock. I now have over 142,000 miles on it and have gotten by with few problems. The motor is strong and pulls hard for being ""outdated"". The only repairs I have done have been the intake gaskets, belt tensioner, alternator and MAF sensor. I regularly take the car to Ohio and WV and it has never let me down. I am now on the hunt for another Alero with fewer miles to replace it. I love the car, so when that time comes, it will be extremely painful to part with.",4.375

Now getting ready to put it to pasture; it's now got cancer behind the doors and 241,000 on it. (It still has the original spark plugs in it!)",3.875

They found it to be very uncomfortable & difficult to get in & out of. It was one of many issues that I would have with the car. I've owned it now for 8yrs & every year I've had to put $ into it!I lost count on how many wheel bearings have been replaced.I've replaced engine; airconditioning unit; gas tank; alternator; starter; just to name a few. Currently; the engine is knocking; the car screams with ac or heat on; needs u joint; gas guage doesn't work. It's been very high maintenance & I would not recommend it.,2.875

It is low mileage for a 1999 - only 68,000 miles. Each time we repair it, we think we'll be okay for a while. I am tired of the cost and am searching for another reliable car now.",2.875

I have had the following problems with it: dash bubbling, intake gasket leaking, blower motor resistor, water pump, both windows have problems, etc. It really is ridiculous, if you look at the reviews for 99' 2-door Accords people have no problems.  Overall, Aleros are quite unreliable with both big and little problems. But for the price you really can't beat it. The Alero has never left me stranded or broken down on the road. Most issues are well known and if you need a cheap $3,000 car you can't beat an Alero.",3.375

It has gone through about 4 wheel bearing, 2 sets of struts, new Drive/Pass seatbelts, 2 resistors for the blower, intake gasket issues twice and replaced the alternator after 90,000 miles. There were other issues but these are being pulled from the top of my head. The good looks on the out and inside are very nice, the drive and handling are excellent and the stock sound system is better than anyone would expect.  One should expect problems with this car, but as consumer reports is showing this is expected from most GM vehicles.  I would not recommend this car.",2.875

The car has had no major problems other than the brakes which I have had to replace three times.  Specifically, I replaced the brake pads three times and rotars once on all four wheels ($500.00 total).  This is not too bad considering the car has been driven for six years.  UNTIL.... the car hit 36,000 miles (funny right after the warranty ran out).  The transmission went and it cost $1,900.00 to fix.  There has been problems with the seals and gaskets to the tune of $400.00 and now it is in the shop for the alternator.  This is all within the last 400 miles after turning 36,000. So, buyer beware.

The first couple of years went okay, but in the third year I had to replace the alternater and soon after that my front brakes went.  My rear view mirror completely fell off when I was driving and since there are wires connected to it I had to drive with the mirror dangling from my windshield.  I can only use my air / heat on the 3 and 4 settings so the air literally sucks the tears from my eyes.  Whenever it rains heavily my driver's side floor becomes completely saturated & I have a puddle of water in my car. Finally, on a day we had a snow storm, the driver's side window fell into the door.

Have not had any major problems. Those other people must have gotten lemons to have so many problems or they beat it to death.

Since I have bought this car, the manifold gasket has had to be replaced twice (I am waiting for it to go out again this winter. This resulted in coolant leaking into the oil.) Also, the driver's side automatic window motor had to be replaced around 50k miles. I have had the front brakes and rotors replaced twice, the rear once. The trunk sometimes takes two tries to close, and it leaks. Brake pedal is too stiff. If you are looking at this car, I suggest to keep looking, or else buy an extened warranty.

When I initially purchased it, there were approximately 43,000 miles on it.  Not bad for a 2000 car of any sort.  I paid cash for it and it is definitely a nice ride for the money (I could never afford a brand new one).  I was also a previous Honda owner (Value Package sedan).  I like my choice.

The lower intake gasket leaked so that screwed up the antifreeze. The resistor that controls the blower motor burned out. There is a rattling noise in front suspension that I can't seem to find. Fortunately I got the extended warranty!  I'd be out a few thousand if I hadn't.  Depreciation is ridiculous!  Paid $11,000 for it in 2002 and its now worth $6,000 retail/$4,000 trade.  I owe $8000.

The check engine light went on right as I drove it home, I didn't think much of it because everything seemed fine. A week later, I went to O'reilly's and got the codes pulled from the computer. Some sort of emissions trouble code and a piston spark plug fire miss code came up. Not a big deal at all, but just troubling since it started on my first drive in it. After that, the A/C compressor bearing went out and it made a loud pinging noise. Since the A/C compressor was such a pain in the butt to get to, I never bothered to get it fixed and just lived without A/C. Next, the stud on the trailing arm in the passenger's rear cracked off which rendered it useless. It wasn't too much of a pain to replace that, but a new trailing arm is quite expensive. After that, the power steering lines rusted through and I had to replace those which was VERY difficult and pretty pricey. Next, the alternator went out and I had to replace that which wasn't too difficult but pricey. Finally, the head gasket blew and it was EXTREMELY difficult to tear apart the engine and replace all the gaskets. Altogether, I got a discount on the materials required which cost around $180 but it took about 3 days to get it all fixed. Took it for a test drive after that and learned that I needed new spark plugs and spark plug wires. I took it around the block twice just to be sure everything was working properly. The next day, the car caught on fire and was totaled. A tiny bit of gas turned out to be leaking out of the return rail and the rusted spark plug wires arced to the motor and sparked the fire which soon became very large and melted a good portion of the wire harness. Overall, I took great care of the car. I frequently checked my fluids and got my oil changed every 3K miles. I definitely got a nightmare car though, note that I only had the car between 160K miles and 168K miles which was only for about 10 months.

We paid $10,700 when it was 15 months old and had 22,000 miles. It has lots of features, such as traction, ABS, CD player and I like the way the lights come on automatically too. My biggest gripes are the parking brake which has no adjustment for the cable,and which I personally feel should be used to protect the auto-box parking pawl, and the over-gearing, a typical GM trait. For a 3.4, it loses power dramtically at the slightest onset of a gradient. Lower gearing would make the performance more reachable and save me having to change down to maintain my momentum.

920, on 08/02/16 11:12 AM (PDT),John ,1998 Oldsmobile Cutlass Sedan GLS 4dr Sedan,"Solid Car, Surpassed Expectations"," 3/14/16I bought this car for $2,200 in 2015 with 78,000 miles on it from a mechanic, and I am pleased to say that I have totally fallen in love with this car. The 3.1 V6 engine is rated at 155 HP at 4800 RPM's, but it has way more power than one would initially suspect. This car powers through Ohio snow very well, and it purrs like a 3000 lb kitten doing so. The transmission shifts smoothly and quietly, and the fluids are easily accessible (which is good, because topping off is an absolute must due to minor leaks). The best part, however, was the car's reliability. It starts like a champ every time, in 100 degree weather and bitter winter deep freezes. I have often seen others unable to start their cars on my street after a winter storm , but my car always starts! The interior is very nice, with leather seats and extra features not readily available at the time (power mirrors, power seats, automatic headlights, etc.) I have had a few minor issues, including belt wear, no a/c, and that awful abs light that wont shut off, but these are minor (I hate abs systems anyway). I have put plenty of love into it, like custom resonated exhaust for a bit of sound, remote start, PLX bluetooth engine monitoring system and more, along with chrome wheels and trim. It looks like a modern luxury Buick now! Do yourself a favor and buy! 85,000 miles and still going strong.Update: 2/3/17For a quick update, not too much has changed. One thing I have noticed now at 91,000 miles is that the V6 is really starting to show poor acceleration. It takes forever to get up the highway ramp. Still starts perfectly. Climate control on this car seems to be a never-ending issue, but I wouldn't attribute that to the car in general. Rust is really starting to kick in, as I have read is common with Olds cars. The exhaust system is under constant siege by rust (I live in Cleveland, Ohio, which undoubtedly accelerates the wear) and I have had a fair amount of welding done to fix the issues. Minor fluid loss (esp. coolant) occurs over time as well, I check and usually need to top off the oil and coolant once a month. Other than that, it still starts, runs, and is very reliable despite being 19 years young.",4

The seats were leather and not oiled so consequently they are cracking like mad in driver's seat and one of the rear seats. That's annoying and given a choice, I'd have opted for cloth because leather and 120 degree weather don't mix! The gas mileage is supposed to be 17-22 but I easily clear 25 in town and 30 if I do 60-65 on highway. In fact, I drove to St. Louis with cruise on at 55 mph and got nearly 38 miles to the gallon!

Its been a decent car and fairly reliable. However, it is seeming to nickel and dime me more and more as time goes on. Since this summer started, the catalytic converter went (at about 62,000 miles), a pulley on the serpentine belt disintergrated due to a bad bearing, the front struts are shot, and now a loud grinding noise seems to be coming from the compressor. In addition, my tapedeck and lights on the radio don't work,  and there is also a ton of rattling in the interior that is only getting worse. Overall, age is not this car's ally.

It was Gasohol that was causing all the problems. Replace Injectors, then a month or two later a different one or the same one would go out again! Techs could not figure it out. It cost us over $700 for 3 new injectors and 2 of them replaced again within their warranty period. One Tech said maybe your getting bad gas if your getting it mainly at one station. I said no, we get it all over but maybe you hit on something, maybe it's the gas as we use gasohol most all the time. Stopped it and the Olds runs fine! On a trip we had to fill up with Gasohol once and it ran rough, put in a can of SeaFoam & cleared it up.",5

Fuel mileage has been 30 mpg highway and 25 city consistently with the AC running. GM parts are readily available and service/repair techs have seen them before. They're not exotic cars. Probably in these four years I've spent another 2,000 to 3,000 on tires, brakes, struts, and ordinary upkeep to accomplish those 45,000 miles. If you must have a new car there are plenty of dealers.

This is a really a car that has grown on me throughout my ownership experience. The seemingly power everything Anniversary Edition has super comfortable leather-trimmed seating with multiple seat memory settings, power pneumatic lumbar adjustment, intuitive steering wheel controls for the HVAC and stereo. Interior fit and finish is very nice but things like panel fitment, fine details can leave a bit to be desired. Really spacious interior, so much headroom, side room, leg room tons of space. Unlike more taut and stiff sport sedans that can deceivingly seem smaller than they are this car feels every bit as big as it is which is very big. The car can feel cumbersome and boat-like at times in city traffic. The automatic/DRL headlights provide extra visibility in the day time and worry-free operation into the twilight hours. The engine is very smooth and surprisingly spirited on the open highway where this car really shines the most. Rearview mirror and driver-side mirror are auto-dimming with the latter also being heated. The rear auto-leveling air struts provide a wonderfully soft and contained ride style over the harshest of road surfaces and heaviest cargo loads.",5

Luckily he was an older fellow who had bought the car new and had taken excellent care of it. All the servicing done on time, and logged in the owners' manual. I was able to pick right up where he left off. About once a month I make a trip up through the Ozark mountains on a twisting, up and down highway and I love the way the car handles and performs. I think that 3.8L is one of the better motors ever manufactured. Plenty of power and and decent gas mileage. I get around 19mpg in town and 26mpg on the highway.

Several mechanics claimed that the vehicle was fine... After three months of white knuckle driving, hanging on to the wheel for dear life at 40 mph, I gave up and sold the thing. Good riddance.

Over the years it has had the normal repairs (brakes, shocks etc.) but overall has been an extremely reliable vehicle.  I have had two 4WD Blazers before this vehicle and they could not begin to compare.  Even after 235K miles this car stills handles and rides like a new car and, most importantly, when I leave home I know I will get back home safely in all kinds of weather. The only problems I am encountering now are due to its age and the fact that this vehicle has been used through 18 winters in NE PA and has been exposed to tons of road salt especially on the PA Turnpike. After last winter I had to have the brake lines all replaced because they had rotted but I certainly can't blame the vehicle given the mileage and heavy winter use it has had.  I really love this car and don't look forward to the day I have to replace it.   If I had to pick one negative aspect of this car it would be the gas mileage.  Usually around 13-14.

I love how the AWD doesn't require any driver input. This can hold a lot of cargo. I once fit 35 large PC's in back. Interior is laid out nicely with the exception of the CD changer which eats up the console. There are plenty of squeaks and rattles but it is 9 years old with 153K miles.

Engine is a little sluggish and the tranny has its quirks... fluid change helped. I get around 15MPG which isn't bad for this type of vehicle. AWD works seamlessly, no buttons or levers to worry about. I don't think I will ever get it stuck. I was able to fit around 35 large size computers from the early 90's in the back with the seats folded. I know sometimes Bravadas are troublesome, hopefully mine stays reliable.

Purchased used with 66,000 miles, still running great. Maintain these like the owner's manual says and it should last you a long time. You need to change transmission fluid at least every 50k miles, as stated in the manual. You also need to have the chassis greased every 10k or so to prevent front end repairs (balljoints, steering joints, etc.).

We keep it serviced and minor issues repaired, and I still use it everyday and not afraid to travel any distance in it.  When it had 125k miles I towed a trailer loaded with a 1960 Ford 4x4 pick-up from northern California to St.Louis, MO with no incidents.

I still get 19- 20mpg ""around town"". We live in the ""rust belt"" with salted winter time roads.

If your GM van is near those miles, WATCH OUT! I'm selling it. It's value has collapsed. I lost big money on this one. I had problems with a Ford Windstar before this.

Paid less than the low value of KBB for a vehicle in this condition.

Since then it has been running great and the fuel economy has been a most pleasant surprise. At first the cruise control didn't work but I found out that by fixing the taillight problem it also fixed that too. The back seats are removable but I found that by just folding the third row forward it more than doubles the rear cargo area and I still have the extra seating if I need it. I used to own a Pontiac Montana and it was a constant pain. Considering this is the same model and engine, the only difference is it was built by Olds. This is the base model so it lacks some of the bells and whistles but it was those same bells and whistles on the Montana that caused so much trouble.

This was an excellent auto for the money.  Only problem was intake manifold gasket at about 180000 miles. Still drives good and handles great on long trips.  Did not appreciate the roll down seats.  Did like 29 MPG highway and 22 mpg around town.  Now we have 210000 miles and it still starts everytime.  Only uses 1/2 quart of oil between changes at 5000 miles.  Actually probably leaks the oil.  Engine still performs without smoking and transmission seems strong.  Would buy this again if it were available.    ,4.75

Now it has 140,000 miles and still looks great.  The dark blue paint has held up exceptionally well even in the Texas sun. Unfortunately, this is not so with tan dash, which has turned a greenish hue. Also, the leather seats have not fared well, with a significant tear in the driver's seat.  The reliability has been excellent, but rattles have increased with age and the rear power vent window motors went out around 120,000 miles.  The air conditioning has been subpar since I had to replace the compressor.  I also replaced the intake manifold gasket. Overall this is a nice vehicle.  The actual in-town gas mileage that I have been getting, 15 mpg, is below this model's rating of 18, but the highway mileage is right on at 25 mpg.

It started leaking oil pretty bad a good 2-3 years before I was done with it. Wish I would have considered fixing the oil leak sooner as It lead to my cars electrical stuff getting ruined because of the oil leaking on it. My car eventually started jerking and dying while I drove it.It would have cost me over 1,500 to fix. Wasn't worth it so I looked into a different car.

Looking around for a replacement, I had my eye on another sedan, but I stopped to look at a used car dealership and this one caught my eye.  I immediatley fell in love with it.  Of course, being used, it has some miles on it, and a few dings and surface scratches, but it is still beautiful.  I've always been a fan of Oldsmobile and the Cutlass, maybe my next one will be the convertible with the 3.4 litre 24 valve dual cam engine.  Knowing me....",4.75

That is if you're comparing it to a BRAND NEW Japanese Luxury Sport Sedan! It seems like every new Maxima, Accura, Camry, Infinity, and even BMW is trying to BE this car!  This does have the negative effect of driving a classic while looking like everything else out there. That's how far ahead of it's time it was. It's BIG. Not as wide as most full-size luxury sedans, but that's actually an advantage. It has a big car ride, but doesn't give a big car driving experience. You know... boring. With it's speed-sensitive steering, it feels more like a Firebird on the open road. You know... exciting! It's a real solid build. Simply stated, check out Wikipedia, who says that it broke GM's frame-crush tester. Then go online and look at some pix.  See how much rust, and how many dents you see on these classics. And with that solid build, you're nearly guaranteed a quiet interior. Let's talk about that quiet interior. The first time I got into mine, if I had gone in blindfolded, when it was removed, I would have thought I was in a European exotic. Most comfortable driver's seat I've ever parked my butt in. High-backed leather bucket. Look at the pix again. See how many cracked seats, dashboards, and door panels you see. Mine doesn't have any. The instrumentation has an understated elegance. The cockpit is completely driver oriented, with a split dashboard that cries out, ""Hands off my controls!"" As a matter of fact, the ashtray is actually quite inconvenient for the front passenger, who actually needs to do a 'reach-around'. CONSIDERING it's size, the gas mileage is GREAT! Out on the highway at 65, I get THIRTY-TWO miles to a gallon. A/C or not.  With the unspeakably comfortable climate control off, I get around 23 in ordinary conditions. And, (groan) about 15 if I do run the EIGHT speed blower fan. But it is absolutely the best A/C I've ever seen in a car. Those are deadly accurate readings. It has a Driver Information Center that tells you virtually EVERY stat you would want to know about fuel. You know... just like a new car. But it does have it's limits! Once it reads that you have a fuel range of 45 miles, it says 'low fuel', and it won't let you reset it. It's like it's saying, ""Look, a-hole, I said you're REAL low! You ain't holding me to a critical prediction!"" All this, while cranking 215 hp out of a 3.5 V6. Now the bad. I'm a member of the Aurora Club of North America, which is a good thing, for a BAD reason. Some mechanics refuse to work on these. There are no Chilton's or Haynes manual available. There are very few in the junk yards, some small parts are non-existent, (in my case, window retaining clips), and they don't generally match up with other GM cars. You-Tube videos showing guys doing repairs on them are non-existent as well. The trunk tends to leak, and the window switches are not switches at all, they are 'triggers', and every time you touch one, you're playing Russian Roulette. You WILL spend some time messing with windows. My driver's window goes about 3/4 of the way down IF you help guide it both up and down. It operates on zip-ties, despite the fact that we did everything we could to get a better fix. I've owned 20 cars in my life, and I've only truly loved three of them. This one, is my all-time favorite. Let's wrap it all up like this. If you asked me to trade my Aurora, for ANY other car, and I couldn't sell it, I could only drive it.... I'd tell you to shove your Jaguar!Well, they asked me to update my review. A 1995 Chevy Suburban plowed into my rear at 40 MPH, with their foot on the gas instead of the brake, while I was stopped at a stop sign. It pushed the trunk in, and destroyed the bumper cowling and fog-lights. Not a BIT of damage to the frame or quarter panels. It didn't even move the car, or give me a jolt.  The only reason I knew I had been tagged was because I heard the crash. This is important, because a smaller car would have been pushed into the intersection, where it would have been T-boned by the right of way traffic.  Drove it like that for 10 months with a bungee holding down the trunk lid. So their insurance gave me double what I paid for it, 1/1/2 months after I bought it. Bought a $400 parts car, paid $750 to a frame shop to pull the trunk, and switched out the doors, because all the windows in my parts car were working. I guess I should add that I drove that parts car 175 miles back home, with a slipping transmission that wouldn't hold any fluid. Even that was a more enjoyable ride than most cars. I have now owned the car for 14 months, and have kicked out for a crank sensor, and a brake line. Had to drop the starter to change the sensor, but was still a relatively cheap and easy repair. When the  sensor went, it didn't leave me sitting. The 'check engine' light came on, and I had to pump the gas to get it going. For a 15 year old car with over 100K, that is GREAT reliability and value.",5
1621, on 04/01/16 05:11 AM (PDT),Michael C ,2001 Oldsmobile Aurora Sedan 3.5 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Worth a lot more than you will pay!," I was an auto broker for many years and I recommended this car to numerous people. Is there a car made that doesn't have problems, of course not, there will never be a ""one and done"" but if you are looking at one of these get it checked out by a mechanic first and then be glad you bought it. The gas mileage for a car of this size is wonderful, the ride is really good. It's roomy front and back and has a massive trunk. The trunk is so big I put a 12"" sub woofer in a box and mounted it in the trunk and I can still get the spare tire out. When you are driving it doesn't feel as big as it is. I have a 2001 with 108,000 miles and it doesn't even let in much road noise at all. I do a ton of driving and the only thing I have done to the car in a year and a half is add an after market stereo. I honestly don't have anything negative to say. To get really nit-picky I'm 5'11"" tall and the seats don't go back as far as i would like. If you are my height or taller you definitely want to check that out first.  I guess you get what you pay for and in my case I got so much more because I paid hardly anything for mine. Even though Oldsmobile isn't being made anymore quite a few different GM products used the same parts.

I traded another 2001 GM vehicle for the Aurora because the Regal had a driver seat with zero comfort.  The Aurora seat with its lumbar support has provided super comfort on my 60 mile drive to work.  Also, who can complain of the 26 mpg hwy. fuel mileage that I am getting?

This car has way to much high tech electronics that has not been tested over time. iv talked to severl owners of these cars with the same problems, also the Battery is an odd size only one that fits is a/c delco vented 135 bucks , and the tires are an odd size to ,had to order .",4.25

The only problem I have found is that the door windows leak in the car wash. With the water sprayed straight at them they leak in all four top corners. I feel that now that we have had one Aurora I hope that we can keep this for a long time. We love it!,5
1760, on 06/10/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Nick DiMarco ,1997 Oldsmobile Aurora Sedan 4dr Sedan,Last of the Oldsmobiles," This car is all I expected out of it. I like the gas mileage on a long trip, I averaged over 31.5 MPG on a 3500 mile trip. The overall ride and handling of the Aurora is great. Your not worn out at the end of a long day driving. No doubt one of the best cars Olds made in the 90's",5
1761, on 05/31/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Gray ,1997 Oldsmobile Aurora Sedan 4dr Sedan,My Dog," I think this car is great. I have had very few problems with it. Some friends of mine went out and got the same car, and one problem we all have is the back window seal leeks. Other than that they are some nice cars.",4.5
