0, on 05/11/12 02:30 AM (PDT),stottsy ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SX 4dr Sedan,Best car ever!!," I bought this car from my sister about five years ago.Sometimes she indicates she would like it back.There is no way she is getting it because I am driving it until the wheels falls off. It has more than 120,000 miles on it.It needs some cosmetic repair.However I haven't had much more than routine repair such as tires, brakes and oil changes.It is too bad they do not make anymore.",4.625
1, on 07/02/10 07:15 AM (PDT),Jswids ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan CDX 4dr Sedan,Great Car! Don't be afraid," Had this car for 8 yrs and had minimal problems. Repair shops will give you the run around if you don't know anything about cars. I can get practically any part for this at the local Autozone. If a mechanic won't touch it you need a new mechanic. He/she should be able to fix anything and it's not rocket since. This car has 4 wheels and an engine just like every other car on the road. Much easier to work on than a VW for sure. I had my doubts when my wife bought it in 2002 but it has been a great vehicle and at 10 years old it looks amazing, is dependable, and cost us practically nothing to own. Great car! Too bad Daewoo went under here. ",4.375
2, on 05/20/10 16:15 PM (PDT),Jerry ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Drive away fast," I bought a the car at 103,000 mile the car need a new windshield a new water pump a new radiator and new muffler all things were replace except the muffler and the car brakes down on me at 104,488 miles. Don't buy any Daewoo. I repeat don't buy the car!",1.375
3, on 01/27/10 10:59 AM (PST),Ed ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Still running strong," I bought this car new and was disappointed by not being told the brand was going belly up by the dealer. Other than that the car has 132,000 miles on it and still runs and drives great.No major problems and I've never gotten bored with the car. I drive it 66 miles round trip to work and it has never left me stranded.I'll drive it as long as it goes. Love the heated mirrors a godsend in Michigan winters and the styling.The cup holders are to small for more than a can of pop.",4.125
4, on 07/06/09 19:44 PM (PDT),ROBERTO VASQUEZ ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SX 4dr Sedan,DAEWOO CRITIC ,"  This is one of the better cars that I    have driven. The ride is very enjoyable, and the automatic transmission is quick to shift and peppy for a four cylinder engine. I like the style and the way it looks outside and inside. The music system is superb and I like the cassette/cd combination. The only letdown is the lack of information on the different parts and where they were manufactured.Information on specifications and a shop manual would be greatly appreciated, since nobody knows the workings of all the different parts and availability for purchasing parts that require replacement and or repair. Diagrams of the various parts would be very useful as would be availability                ",4.5
5, on 05/24/08 18:56 PM (PDT),LongDistance ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Farewell to my road partner," I purchased my Laganza brand new in Feb 01.  I had only 3 cars before her yet none as good.  Never had any major problems, only recently the dealership that serviced her closed and there was no one reliable to take care of her.  The other week the timing belt snapped.  So now I lay her to rest ... If there was another one out there I'd buy it today - the best car I've ever had.  Farewell Silver Bullet",5
6, on 02/27/06 11:49 AM (PST),Joshua ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SX 4dr Sedan,Not bad for the money," I was a little hesitent about buying a daewoo after all the problems I have heard that people have, but for $1,300 it wasnt that bad. bought car with 90k on it, and has a little over 94k. No problems, maybe a little oil leak, but all is well, and the ""POWER"" feature doesnt work. Great gas milege, about 400 miles per tank. leather a bit stiff and seats really offer no comfy position. Dont recomend driving far in this thing cause not comfy, but around town its good. Engine takes a while to warm up for it to shift into 4th, CD player and sound system average. A few quirks here and there, but thats to be expected. Even if the car goes another 30,000 miles,i believe that is well worth the $1,300.",4
7, on 11/16/05 13:07 PM (PST),Ravuun ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Great Little Korean Car for a good price," This car has lots of room for backseat passengers, plenty of trunk space, and even a decent stock stereo speaker system.  It packs a lot of get-up-and-go, and seems like it wants to go faster!  Despite weird little problems, such as the malfunction indicator light malfunctioning, you can't beat the Daewoo Leganza for the price!  We do a lot of driving between Bellingham, WA and Seattle, WA, and this car has taken the wear and tear beautifully.",4.125
8, on 07/28/05 10:51 AM (PDT),Weaver ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SX 4dr Sedan,turned into maintenance nightmare," Bought car new 1/2000 and got rid of 1/2005. Maintenance costs escalating.... after 2003 Only 1 dealer left in 100 mile radius  who would touch it and EVERYTHING was special order. Couldnt even go to regular muffler shop like Midas, Meineke...Exhaust system cost me over $800. First 50k miles great, but if you are buying one used with 60-80k, get evidence of new timing belt or DONT BUY IT!!! Replaced at 65k with other items, I caught just before it gave out, dealer had 3 others in with blown engines...Daewoo seemed to have designed this to blow up 5000 miles after powertrain warr.expired. Often check engine light issues as well. Gas mileage started to deteriorate rapidly after 70-75k mi",2.625
9, on 07/25/04 00:00 AM (PDT),Ali E ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan CDX 4dr Sedan,My God - What a car!," Being a construction engineer, I knew of Daewoo's high quality in heavy earth moving equipment.  Over the past 20 years I've owned a Buick Lesabre, a Mitsu Galant, and a Honda Accord. All new.  I must say that these auto these brands - along with others - are probably relieved that Daewoo is no longer around.  In my considered experiance, this Leganza CDX is indeed better than any other car I have ever owned, on many fronts.  The styling, handling, ride and build quality, features and duribility are supurb.  I purchased mine for $16,999.  In contrast, I remember a Saturn (with far fewer features less power and sloppy ride) with a sticker price of $24,789!!",4.625
10, on 06/25/04 00:00 AM (PDT),Rocky/C ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Aerodynamically Quick," The Leganza is a pleasant surprise and has a nice styling appeal (possibly Italian). It's lightweight and sporty.  It is quicker than most cars and has a strong suspension and can out run a lot of cars. It's a road runner on the highway and clips along tremendously fast and solid.  The seats are real comfy and it is easy to maintain if properly tuned and oiled, which is a must.  The tires are speed rated and stock at 50,000 miles. The brakes work like magic and it's one of the funnest cars I've ever driven. (#1 of 8 cars I've owned), it really motors!!!",4.75
11, on 02/29/04 00:00 AM (PST),waterfoul ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Daewoo 2000 SE, Best car I ever owned. Just wish Daewoowas still in the US. I feel if giventime this car maker would have over runall imports.,4.875
12, on 01/27/04 00:00 AM (PST),evondy ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Chincy," We've had the car for 2 years and had quite a few problems including odometer issues, cruise control problems, engine running hard, bad brakes, and various cosmetic issues on the interior.",2.875

14, on 11/08/03 00:00 AM (PST),Big Jim 5544 ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan CDX 4dr Sedan,Daewoo, Honda-like in build quality.  Nothinggoes wrong with this car.  After 37000miles still drives and feels as new.Fuel economy exceeds EPA estimates forthe highway.  Use of Mobil 1 oid mayhelp.  Minor wind noise from sunroof. Only problem of note is the factorytires.  Showing much wear.  Replacementwith better quality tires may help tirelife. ,4.75
15, on 11/01/03 00:00 AM (PST),pondlily ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,It's a Great Car," Pros:I have had this car for almost 3 years and have absolutely no complaints about reliability or performance.  I have had to do nothing to it except for scheduled maintenance. It is a very good looking car, right up there with the more expensive models.  Cons:The gas mileage is mediocre in town but up to 29 mpg on the freeway.  The radio needs to be replaced with a good one.  The steering wheel hides the speedometer when it is in its lower positions. This car has been seriously maligned because of the bankruptcy of Daewoo, but the quality of the car speaks for itself.  Now that GM is handling parts there should be no concern about service.",4.375
16, on 07/30/03 00:00 AM (PDT),jscott1 ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Daewoo, I love the car! I only wish it was worth more. I feel like I really got taken advantage of with Daewoo going bankrupt!,5
17, on 07/06/03 00:00 AM (PDT),cunn78 ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Great Car, This car was a great buy.  It was too bad about the company going under in the US. I'm sure they would have produced many other great autos.,5
18, on 02/13/03 00:00 AM (PST),qoatzecotl ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,My Experience," I had no problems at all with my car. After reading the review of the ""experts,"" I have to disagree with their notes on the suspension being less than good. I think that it is a great car at a good price. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good value.",4.625
19, on 01/24/03 00:00 AM (PST),JSuggest ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan CDX 4dr Sedan,Just AWE-SOME!!!!!!!, This car the the most stylish car I've ever driven.  Don't worry about the media driven negative crash tests.  Have you ever eaten hot dogs?  This is the  style and class for cheap.  ABS and Traction Control will make you smile in close call conditions...,5
20, on 01/10/03 00:00 AM (PST),TheJazzMan ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SX 4dr Sedan,Leganza - Nice car (with the hassle), Bought the car in 2000 with 42k miles. Love driving it! Taken it to Penn State numerous times with no problems. Drive it NYC and no problems. It has a very nice interior and the ride is superior. I think it deserves a V6 for a lot more power. I now have 52k miles and a big problem with this car is oil leaking. Had the valve cover gasket replaced at 48k and now need a new rear main seal. Otherwise it's a very good car...needs new cupholder design and the fuse cover stinks.,4.125
21, on 11/24/02 00:00 AM (PST),Weaver ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SX 4dr Sedan,"Great car, wish it had better resale"," I've had this car almost 3 years with very minimal problems. I am just facing the drawback of resale after paying $16k in January 2000. But if you can steal one of these used for $5000 or so do it! Quality CD sound system, comfortable leather seats, good handling on snow.  Fuel injectors can be a bit sensitive to make the engine light come on but it wasnt anything to worry about...so I would recommend adding a bottle of injector cleaner to your fuel tank every couple months. My local Toyota (formerly Daewoo and Toyota) dealer assures me that service will not be a problem even with the discontinuance of the Daewoo line.",4.75
22, on 09/26/02 00:00 AM (PDT),Karleebrooke ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Too bad they went bankrupt...," I purchased my Laganza used. I feel in love with the style of the car. (I thought it was a Lexus at first)Then when I sat in the car I noticed how much leg room it had. I was sold after that. I have had to replace the sensor light twice, but that was covered under warranty. Otherwise the car has given me no problems. I found it to be very reliable and dependable. Everything under the hood is easy to find as well.The get up and go is okay. I found it to be equal to that of a Honda Civic.  I do wish it had more power when you have the A/C on. And the gas mileage is fair.",3.75
23, on 06/21/02 00:00 AM (PDT),fhd ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Daewoo Leganza," I have had only two problems with the car.  First, the rear window defroster was not operating correctly.  Found out from the dealer that it was unplugged.  The second problem is that the brakes wore through too fast.  The first set of brakes were replaced at 13,000 miles.  The second set at 32,000 miles.  It could be all of the in-city and up-and-down hills in traffic.    Everything else about the car is great.",4.625

I purchased my 2000 Leganza in 2001, drawn to consider the purchase because of the low price for an auto with so many ""luxury"" appointments, coupled with the fact that I had been impressed while riding in one that a friend had rented when he was visiting in Ca.Factoring in the price I rate this vehicle a ""10"".",4.875

Last week, I went to trade-in my car and one dealership offered me $2300 and another said he could squeeze $5300 ($600 of that was because of the leather). My car is clean shining, beautiful, everybody ideal automobile but worth NOTHING. I WAS SHOCKED!!!",4

They replaced lifters,didn't leave the parking lot. Then a head,worked a week, then another engine. One week later it started again. Car was down for 71 days total. Called BBB and was eager to help. Now after filing THREE times my case has been refused. Now plummeting value has caused me to pay dearly to get out of car. I was offered $5,000 tradein lastweek! Beautiful cars,loaded with great standard features but I should have saved my money and bought a used one for less than half.

29, on 03/26/02 00:00 AM (PST),Troy ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan CDX 4dr Sedan,Solid Car for the Money," I've had my Black Leganza CDX for 2.5 years and it's been a great car for the money. The only reasons to buy this car are A) to save big $$ upfront vs. Toyota, etc; and B) better styling (w/ custom Konig wheels). Only problem I've had is with occasional buzzing I get from equalizer when I start the car which kills me since Daewoo is better known for electronics.",4
30, on 03/16/02 23:02 PM (PST),Devin ,2000 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SX 4dr Sedan,Big Driver," I have driven my Daewoo a lot.  With the exception of having to replace the from bumper because the spoiler cracked, it has been a good car.  It is unfourtunate that the company is in trouble because I believe these cars are better then other Korean car makers. Handling is sloppy for its type of suspension.",3.75

NOTHING was maintained on it and I only JUST have had to start doing the typical, tie rod replacements break pads and so on and so fourth. Of course I would love to own a brand new car but my car is still amazing. Anyone who says Daewoo's are horrible cars that will leave you on the side of the road are WRONG! My boyfriend has a scion and I laugh when I watch how many times he fills up in a week going the same distance as I do, actually less my job requires me to travel alot and I never have to worry about it failing!

STINSON ,2002 Daewoo Leganza Sedan CDX 4dr Sedan (2.2L 4cyl 4A),Excelent Performance and Appearence, Purchased a Daewoo Leganza CDX because the dealer was giving away a free Daewoo if you bought one.

Great deal and it came with all the options except leather and sunroof. I originally purchased to drive while I rebuilt my truck and was suprised at the features and ride comfort for a inexpensive ride for the money (even if it was at MSRP would be a good value in the class it was selling in) I have no problem getting parts or warranty work (headlight moisture) completed in a timely manner.

It is a GREAT car. I LOVE IT!! I am a bit concerned about the availability of parts and service. So far all I have needed to order was a new rear view mirror (x boyfriend broke)and I got it within a week. A great deal for me.

It was with quite a bit of trepidation that I decided to go with a Daewoo considering the uncertain future of the company. But I was impressed with the pliant ride and minimal lean upon testing driving the car. The exterior finish on my silver Leganza simply sparkles. The interior is room and comfortable.

It's features are second only to Lexus.  My father-in-law purchased a Honda Accord just before I purchased the Leganza. He warned me to not purchase the car. When I did buy it and showed him, he felt very depressed! He paid $5,000 more for his car and it didn't even have leather!

You might as well just flush your money down the drain.  I think this car appeals to people who simply want to say they have leather, a CD player, etc. regardless of the quality.  Admittedly, less than 20K gets you a bunch of features, sadly they are poorly built.",2.375

Same interior and exterior dimensions. Better styling. Same gas mileage. Better acceleration, and you don't have to pay a premium for the name. Say what you want about Korean cars, but don't forget where Honda and Nissan/Datsun were 15 years ago. I bought a base model a year and a half ago. I have 23,000 miles on it an I have never had a problem. I loved it so much I bought one for my wife. Obviously her's had every option, but with incentives it came to only 16,200.",4.375
49, on 05/15/10 18:47 PM (PDT),photolarry ,1999 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SX 4dr Sedan,Cheaply built // HORRIBLE fuel economy !," Bought my Leganza SX in August 2009 hoping that this sub-compact would be easy on gas like a typical asian-built car ( 2 liter , 4 cylinder ). I do lots of driving (short 30 minute highway drives multiple times a day) and the gas consumption is HORRIBLE , my friend with a Infiniti I30t (6 cyl) and a Mustang LX 5.0 v8 gets better mileage than this car !!!! This is NO Honda/Nissan or Toyota !!! The car ""feels"" cheap , mass-produced and frail. Handling is loose and sloppy and the motor/steering feels like it's laboring at higher speeds. All in all , like the old saying goes , ""You get what you paid for"" ; it's no wonder these used cars are cheap to purchase ! Expensive parts ! STAY AWAY !",2.625
50, on 06/23/07 22:47 PM (PDT),LJGotsDaewoo ,1999 Daewoo Leganza Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,I'm Lovin' It," Okay, so when people think of Daewoo they think of microwaves. This car is so much better. It was the best $26000 I spent back in 01. I love the styling, I think it looks better than a Jaguar. And me, I'm a big girl and the seat fits. The stereo is lovely. I love the bass. The fuel economy is excellent too. It usually averages 22 combined. I love my Daewoo and I will never sell it. My baby's baby's will have this car.  They need to bring Daewoo back. They are good looking powerful cars. I love this car!",5

It is great on gas mileage, it still holds between 32 -35 mpg.  I have only had to fix normal things like brakes and oil changes.

The best investment was swapping the bad Hancook tires for BF Goodrich Traction T/A tires; it has improved the ride, performance and MPG of the Nubira.This car is definitely a keeper, if not for a daily driver then for a perfect backup vehicle and will be used to the very end which according to my mechanic could quite possible be another 50,000+ miles.",4.875

I did have to put in a new transmission - like I said badly maintained rather than bad product.

It's kind of a rare car wherever you go and parts are nothing short of a scavenger hunt but with appropriate maintenance, the thing is a survivor. It has come with its share of problems though.

It is a zippy little car, although it lacks punch in its acceleration - you can hear the poor motor strain sometimes. The ""power"" button is fun to use, giving the car a jump ahead, but eats up fuel when used.My husband doesn't like the poor safety ratings of the car, but (knock on wood) I haven't had to employ any of those features. I love the unique cloth on the seats - it's a cool pattern! Over all, it's been a good car with no major malfunctions.

Bought it right off the showroom floor in October of 2000. In the 14 years of owning it its only needed minor maintence. In 2001 and in 2002 it needed brakes both times as the factory brakes were defective from the beginning. It needed more brakes in 2009 when a mechanical failure occured. In 2008 it needed a new battery the OEM battery lasted 8 yrs, In 2013 it needed brake lines and a brake hose and in 2014 it needed a new thermostat. All in all this car is great it is dependable and it has lasted most of 14 years on just oil changes. Only problem ive had with it is the fact the A/C never worked from the getgo",4.75

Greatest purchase i ever made.Even the hubby(ford ute man) loves to drive it and i have trouble getting the keys back off him!

I have had my 'woo for almost three years and it has never broken down, and has only needed its regular maintenance. I've driven it across the Midwest at least three times, and from Missouri to New York and back without a care. The only issue I have had to deal with was a recall on a small part in the engine, which was replaced at no cost. It is very easy to drive, and runs just fine in winter weather.

I get around 23-28 miles to gallon and on long trips I'm sure I'll get even better.

They really cheaped out on parts of the car like the visors, controls as well as other areas that wouldn't hurt to of improved a little bit more. Stereo is great but the cd player will start the song over if turned off and the track up button sometime goes down instead of up. The cupholder blocks the cd player and buttons are often hidden.
