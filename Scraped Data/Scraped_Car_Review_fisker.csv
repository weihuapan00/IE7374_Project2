Talk about a sexy poster child for green vehicles.First couple months had some little software bugs with the touchscreen and check engine lights however nothing that impacted driving. Software patches have put that behind us and now just enjoy driving around a technological and artistic masterpiece. ",4.875

Rebooted multiple times in motion the first 24 hours.No one calls you back with any certaintly or help.Company refuses to take them back, so do not take delivery unless you want the buyer beware speech.You will be plagued by constant and chronic failures, unless you like waiting 5 minutes to reboot or waiting weeks for any response.Bottom line is there is no fix. Expect a car that works.",2.125

I have had several days with my new Karma, and I love it. I Have driven 300 miles and used only two gallons of gas! The design catches more eyes than I thought, as people are constantly pulling out their cell phones and taking pictures of it.Charging at night is simple. Plug it in and forget it.Interior is comparable to any of the many European luxury cars I have owned, only more plush.Drives like a big car, it does weigh 5300 lbs, but it handles much better than I thought it would.
