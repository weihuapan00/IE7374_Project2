As the first new RWD sports coupe since the late '80's from Japan reveals a classic sports design that is an eye catcher to others on the road. It has enough power to maneuver without fear of failing on very twisty country roads. For example, I can woosh through a curve marked 15 mph at 45 mph or more. When it comes to stop, it stops as the brakes do not fade. I have not enjoyed a sports car like this one since I purchased a pocket rocket Eclipse back in 1993. This car has style, creature comfort, and driver confidence built in. The boxer engine is a real plus. Some argue this car needs more power but I am not convinced. Any great driver knows how to max out a well designed car regardless of engineering limitations. To say otherwise is just plain lame. Besides, why lose fuel economy with a larger engine when the average speed out of red light is proportional to someone else's car? Forget dragster with this care. Embrace true sports car driving instead. After all, it remains stable through turns and a dragster does not, This car is all about balance and fun.",5

It is comfortable, good looking, and fun to drive. It also has amazing handling. The only thing the car needs is more horsepower and low end torque (which can be done). All in all, it is definitely a bang for your buck.",4

Looks like the type of car HOT WHEELS should have out in their toy line. Seems to catch the eyes of all men young and old. A older man walked up to me one day in a parking lot and said ""This is a really nice looking car. It looks like your moving fast and your parked."" I get compliments where ever I go and cars are forever coming up wanting to race me.",5
3, on 10/08/16 15:03 PM (PDT),Winstonscifi ,2015 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6A),A great road-tripper!," We wanted a great car to drive around the country. Our last sports car, a Chrysler Crossfire was perfect. We checked out a Miata and a Fiat Spyder, but there was just not enough trunk space. This Scion FR-S was perfect. Plenty of room. Great handling. 35 miles per gallon on the highway. And, since it was a new 2015, the dealer had it priced with a discount of $3000!Well, we've had the car for a year now, and I'm still very happy with it. I'm pleasantly surprised by the gasoline mileage - I average over 30 miles per gallon with every fill-up. The car has been rock solid in reliability. I've taken advantage of the ToyotaCare free maintenance - no cost oil and filter changes and tire rotations every 7500 miles. I'll be going in for the 15000 mile check up in about a month. Very happy with the Scion FR-S!",5
4, on 08/16/16 08:41 AM (PDT),Rain S ,2015 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6A),"Reliable, Fun"," Scion FRS known for you JDM fanatics like myself included as Toyota 86, really pays homage to the true meaning of a sports car not just based on 0-60 but RWD, great handling, brakes, suspension. Sure it won't be 0-60 fast like the Mustangs, Challengers, Camaro but the car itself is truly engaging to drive whether or not it's a automatic or manual it may not be everyone's cup of tea but this car doesn't pretend to be. The way the automatic is programmed is truly different experience from ones I've driven and to note I've driven many MT cars from Civic SI, Celica GT, MK3 Supra, it gets the job done especially if you intend to daily drive this car, now if your gonna track the heck out of this then MT might suit you more. Make sure you have on sport mode and sport trac to get the most of the paddle shifters. To really appreciate this car you really need to drive it and I've been more than satisfied to what the designers and engineers did. There's thousands of ways to mod and customize this car as well but for me the HIDS with LED, rebadge, drop in intake was all that it needs.",5
5, on 01/23/16 13:55 PM (PST),David Krishan ,2015 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),FR-S Great bang for your buck," This car isn't a rocket. It's a drifting, handling demon. If you want to go to the track and eat Mustangs, move on. You won't win. But if you want to have tremendous fun on corners, and a lively ride in traffic, this definitely is a car to consider.Yes, it's a bit underpowered acceleration-wise. You have to know that going in. And don't even consider automatic - 6-speed all the way or go home. That said, it is SO much fun to whip around traffic, take 90-degree turns at 50mph+, etc. It corners like a dream and is incredibly responsive. It's just a fun car.Also, it's a 2-seater. It may have four seats, but unless your friends are quad-amputees or children, they won't fit in the back. This is purely a 2-person cruising machine. The only way it would be more fun is if they made it a convertible.I have an hour-commute each way every day to work, and it puts a smile on my face every time I get in it. I have no regrets buying it.Edit 2 years later: I still love this cat for my daily driver. It is agile, small, but not Miata-small, you know? And while I will never win races in it, the handling on it is everything you could want from even a Porsche-level car. Definitely a keeper.I would recommend the Subaru BRZ over the Toyota however. The interior is much nicer, the service/warrantee better, and the price more or less the same.",5
6, on 12/29/16 07:04 AM (PST),Stephanie Gavidia ,2016 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Beautiful car, It's a beautiful car has very good speed. Very comfortable from the inside. Very sport car the interior has two colors black and red. The outer color is dark blue gray beautiful color. Once you buy this car you will not regret it you'll fall in love.,5

While idling, the car emits a high pitched chirping noise which is annoying and embarrassing coming out of a ""sports"" car. There are many complaints online about this; over 85% of owners say that have this problem. The driver side window squeaks when sliding up. The leather is cheap and gets destroyed when rubbed while trying to enter the car. In regards to performance, I knew the car had 200 hp before I purchased it but, wow, it is freaking slow! Yes the handling is amazing but the cheap stock tires will slide the car everywhere. And don't even think about racing the car next to you on the green light; a standard sedan is faster than this car.I complained to the dealership and to Toyota Motor Sales about the chirping noise. They have a technical service bulletin that states this noise is an ABNORMAL noise yet they will tell you to your face that it's a normal characteristic of the car.If you go to a dealership with interest in the FRS, they will not tell you about the chirping noise. They are deceptive but hey, it's a dealership right?",1
11, on 04/23/15 07:16 AM (PDT),Roger Littlepage ,2014 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),"My daily driver, and favorite car I have had"," This is my daily driver and this puts a smile on my face every day (even after a year of ownership).  Handling is amazing!  It is definitely quick, yes straight line performance numbers doesnt do this car justice.  It is fast through the corners and if you manage the RPMS to stay in the power band it will not disappoint.  Some negatives: passengers riding on the highway have complained about a rougher ride (think sports suspension) and there is wind and road noise (I still have crappy stock tires on it, which adds to it).  Get behind the wheel and you will never be bothered by any of this.  This car is more than numbers, it has that enjoyment factor that cant be measured. ",4.75
12, on 05/16/18 16:31 PM (PDT),John ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),A real drivers car," Look at the videos of Matt Farah or Chris Harris driving various modified and unmodified versions of this car,  which is the same car as the Subaru BRZ or Toyota 86.     Or my favorite review by the German reviewer Thomas Hellmanzik who is part of the youtube channel Everyday Driver,  published Aug 3 2017.     This car is not for everyone,   but it is definitely going to be appreciated by a certain group of drivers who might also like the Miata/MX-5 but want a real coupe.     I've had a Miata and the FRS is a better highway car and a better mountain car in my opinion.     The car is a little bit boring in casual driving,    for everyday trips I often take a lazier kind of car or pick up truck,    but probably because I am a little older and like my creature comforts if the roads are not exciting.    But if you have the shifting skills to keep this car in its power band above 4500 rpm and the right roads,   this car can absolutely blow your mind and give you a driving experience far beyond the price they are asking for it,   especially used.    Its low,   small,  lightweight and extremely rewarding and capable all the way to the limit,   while also being very predictable and tactile.     Its pretty loud,   and somewhat cramped.     I consider it a better more modern version of the old Datsun 240z.",5

14, on 04/03/18 11:40 AM (PDT),Hans ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Amazing handling and FUN," Loved this car for the handling and cheap driving fun it provides. Needs mods for sure and has no power, but it compensates those deficiencies with its amazing handling, steering feel and reliability.",4
15, on 12/11/16 18:47 PM (PST),Fabien Ahmed ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),"Great, but not for everyone!"," I just turned in my lease for this car. I'm sad to see it go. If my situation was a little different I would buy a 2017 model, which happens to address some small annoyances I had with the car - road noise and some roughness on the road.This was not a car where the head of the company said ""let's make the most profitable car we can"" or, ""let's design a car that will kill other cars."" This car was designed out of the desire for something raw and pure. This car was built for a niche population. Luckily, the population of the niche wasn't so small that this car would be unprofitable.First, let's talk about the power. I think whether this car has enough power for you or not is all a matter of perspective. For me, I drive on mostly cramped Massachusetts roads where I find that the HP of an economy car is plenty. So the 200 hp of this car plus its low weight, is far more than I need. In fact, if there was a 150hp version with better gas mileage, I would've gotten that. But to enjoy this car, you really have to like driving. You have to enjoy feeling the road, you have to enjoy techniques like heel-toe downshifts, you have to enjoy turning, and you have to enjoy putting in the extra work to keep this car in its power band with its short gearing. And of course, you have to enjoy feeling connected with the car. If you enjoy doing all these little things, you'll love this car, because this car makes those things great. But if you're not into that, all the work it takes to enjoy this car can be really overwhelming. For a period of time during my lease I fell into a slump where I was lethargic and had low energy. Nothing in particular happened to me, I just got lazy. During that time, I absolutely hated this car. Everything was just overwhelming. I enjoyed driving my 2002 corolla more than this. But once I got out of that slump and had a lot of energy, this car became one of my greatest pleasures again.The reliability in 40k miles of driving was decent I'd say. I had to replace the battery, alternator, and all brake pads & rotors. Also, I drove this car through three winters with snow tires, and it performed really well. Definitely better than a FWD with all seasons, except for perhaps accelerating up a steep hill. I was quite often on the leftmost lane of the highway cruising between 40-55 mph during heavy snow and I still had quite a bit of traction. This is actually where the lower power of the car comes in handy, you want to use just enough power to get the tires rolling which is much easier to do in a lower hp car than a higher one.I think Toyota and Subaru did an excellent job for the money in accomplishing what they set out to do. They wanted a raw, responsive, balanced, stable, light-weight car, and that's essentially what we got. But like I said... not for everyone. If it's not for you, this car could be overwhelming with all its feed back or even boring with the relative lack of power if that's what you're into the most. But if it is for you, it's the best.",4
16, on 06/02/16 19:51 PM (PDT),Matt Guerra ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),FRS - ThrowOut Bearing Failure &  Customer Service," Ok... I'll start saying that I love this car; it's great to drive, engaging, responsive and lots of fun.  Yes, there's an annoying torque dip in the power band, but you can live with it.  My cautionary tale is regarding its reliability and the willingness from Toyota/Scion to go the extra step  (no, not mile) to help their customers.  I say that because I have worked with customer service directly or indirectly for the last 16 years and I expected more from a brand with reputation for reliability.I have bought the car used and I am its second owner.  It has only around 27k miles and I have well maintained the car with regular oil changes (synthetic), only shell V-power 93 octane gas, flushed the transmission and differential oil, checked brakes etc -- all items from the manual within their mileage.This Saturday evening while going to have dinner with my wife, we noticed a squeaky noise when I pushed the clutch pedal.  It is nothing really alarming, but it clearly indicates something is wrong and some part is wearing down.  It was too late to call the closest dealer and, since Monday was national holiday, I brought the car to a Kwik Kar close to my house.  I have researched some forums and the mechanic confirmed: it was the throwout bearing.  It was disappointing, considering that I drive mostly highways and I've never tracked or autocrossed the car -- and it doesn't even have 30k miles.  I called the dealer on Tuesday, the only day available, and asked them to check when my warranty expires.    Surprise: it expired on 05/29.  I was calling on 05/31.  The guy was very helpful and felt sorry for me and I asked if they could make an exception, they answered it doesn't depend on them -- they have to get the exception approved by Toyota's Customer Service directly to their management team.  Time to call the customer service.The representative Peter was helpful and opened a case number for me, in theory to ask for a decision regarding if they would approve a service under the warranty due to the circumstances and said that someone would contact me back within 2 days max.  No one contacted me, so today I called again.  I talked to Vince this time, he explained that this case number was only to document what happened.  It would need an authorized (from a Toyota dealer) inspection to verify  if the issue was actually throw out bearing, and if I decided to build a case for warranty it would still have to be within the warranty, therefore I had no way out since it was expired.  He said I was misinformed by the previous rep on my expectations.I said I understood that the warranty per se had just expired, but if I could speak to his manager or someone who had the power to approve an exception since it was an unusual issue for a car fairly new and with low mileages.  Per Vince, the warranty cannot be extended or any time-grant extension cannot be conceived; there are absolute no exceptions at all.  He stressed that no one, regardless of hierarchy in the company, could approve the service under warranty since it is expired, and he was a representative in power to make these statements because there was no decision to make.I like this car.  Yes, before I said I loved this car, I know.  But considering the confidence that Toyota inspired me with such an early failure and poor customer service, I will take the hit this time, but I am not likely to ever buy another product from them again.  Who knows what will happen to the car when it is 70k miles;  I might not keep it to find out.  Oh, if you search forums you will see several similar cases of early failure of this component.  Do your research before you commit to a car....................06/16/2016 - Quick update for what is worth; I called again the Dealer and they honored the warranty, even though Toyota did not.  The car is fixed and I give 5 stars for the dealer which went the extra mile and provided a great customer service.  Toyota as a brand, however, left a sour taste in my mouth.  If you find a good dealership, stick to it....................06/21/17 - I have trade the FRS in for a Mustang which has been way more comfortable (and fast) as a daily driver since I live in north Texas and here the roads are basically (boring) highways, plus the high revving character from the FRS is a nightmare in traffic.  I have the Mustang for over 6 months now and I have to say, there is not even one day I don't miss driving the Scion, but I am glad it is not my daily driver anymore.  It (FRS) is one of the most fun cars you can buy in its price range, only second to the MX-5.  If you don't mind the lack of refinement in the interior and if your roads are curvy enough, you will be very happy with the car.  Engaging, telepathically responsive, amazing chassis, decent gearbox (please flush the transmission oil and replace it with Motul Gear 300, trust me) and great feedback from the steering wheel.  Great second car or daily driver on fun roads.",4
17, on 05/20/14 21:37 PM (PDT),garrett2000 ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Overall very disappointing," I have the 6 speed manual.There are 2 main problems with the car, the first being the severe lack of power.Scion claims this car has 200 HP, I beg to differ, it's lucky if it has 150.The acceleration is absolutely terrible, and the hesitation off the line makes the situation even worse.However, once it's in 3rd gear or later, it does get a little better.The other thing that bothers me about the car is the transmission grinds when shifting from 1st to 2nd, and from 2nd to 3rd.It doesn't happen every time, but happens enough to be severely annoying. The only redeeming quality of the car is the styling.It looks like a sports car, but that's where the similarity ends.",3.25
18, on 12/30/13 22:13 PM (PST),oceaneer77 ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),So Far Great," I had for a very long time an old porsche 928 s4. It was a amazing car, and I thrashed the crap out of it. It died a terrible death...The new Scion replaced it. The Sion is not nearly as fast, nor as flashy. But it is WAAAAY more fun. At every red light the little 4 gives it a mighty big BRAAAPPPP and off we go. The shift points are just pure joy. This is not a car that will set a new land speed record, or corner at speeds that make your brains turn to mush. BUT----It is a very fun car that is amazingly responsive. It puts a smile on your face driving in city traffic as its sure is a little street fighter. Its great on the highway and its MPG is amazing.The car has a real soul.",4.75
19, on 10/23/13 11:32 AM (PDT),worldrally17 ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Best Driver's Car," Don't listen to everybody who berates this car.Those are the people who don't understand its purpose.After 10,000 miles through 6 states and Canada, I can tell you this car is great in every single circumstance.City, highway, straight road, twisty road, road course, etc.I can get 34mpg on the highway, and average 31mpg even with some autocrosses and track days sprinkled in.You can fit a 6' person in the back as long as the front passenger is willing to give up some leg room.I honestly test drove every single new car with a manual transmission under $25k and this was by far my favorite.",4.625
20, on 05/22/13 17:02 PM (PDT),buhlonee ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),The most smiles per mile," Purchased my Asphalt Grey FR-S 6-speed manual in June of 2012.Traded up from a 2002 WRx (original owner), and while I miss the all-wheel drive and turbo rush, my FR-S just makes me smile every time I'm behind the wheel.Mine is primarily used as a weekend fun car, and I argue that there is nothing out on the road today that is even close in price that makes you feel as connected to the pure, visceral driving experience as this $24K gem.The steering is easily controlled, the shifter is perfect and the engine grumble is nice (I'm a sucker for boxster engines).I would not use this as a daily driver, but as a second car, it is just perfect.",4.625

It is the perfect car for me (I'm 23) it is fun, fast, and so far reliable. The gas milage is also pretty good. I just have two complaints the first one is that I wish there were volume controls on the steering wheel the second is I wish it was called the Toyota 86 (like the rest of the world) but other than those two things I love the car and would reccomend it to anyone!",4.875
22, on 03/29/13 21:27 PM (PDT),rudycassap ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Amazing Car For the Money," Lucky for us, Toyota put this under the Scion brand so dealers cannot mark it up.I live in the Los Angeles area and cars still disappear from some dealers lots in a matter of a day or two. I did accept the fact that the dealer installed Lojack. Got mine in Asphalt Black (dark grey metallic, really) with the rear wing and TRD exhaust installed from the factory. I had test driven a car with the stock exhaust.While the TRD exhaust has a beautiful note, it makes it difficult to have a conversation with a passenger. Still, I would take the exhaust over stock. Seats are supportive and instrument gauges are perfect (very much like Porsche). Car reminds me of a Lotus - light, small, minimalist.",4.75

Though it is easy to drive at low speeds and in the city, it really comes alive when you push it along windy roads and at high speed. It is simply the most solid, capable car I have ever driven. If you just want to look good, accelerate quickly and tour around - this isn't the car for you. I also like its small environmental footprint and ultra-sophisticated engineering where it counts. This car has a bleeding edge fuel system, a high performance, but ultra-reliable engine and Toyota/Subaru quality.It is small and lightweight. If you drive thoughtfully, the mileage is about 26 City and 36 highway - much higher than EPA's estimate.",4.875
24, on 07/15/12 23:54 PM (PDT),pukalady ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6A),A real Gem," I owned a 2006 Scion TC that I bought in 2007.Loved that car and was searching the internet for more two door cars and the 2013 Scion FR-S came up and I was hooked.I went to my Scion dealer here in Kahului on Maui , Hawaii on May 25th .They told me the car would debut on June 1.I had to wait a week!June 1st, 2012 back to the dealer I went and three hours later I drove out with the ""whiteout"" color (not a good name for the color, it's a real pearl oyster white).I use ethanol free gas right now and get 35 mpg. I just love the way it ""gets out of theway"" of everyone else .I did get the automatic and won't be using the snow mode.And by the way I'm 67 yrs. old and LOVE my car",5
25, on 06/05/12 21:24 PM (PDT),jlennox ,2013 Scion FR-S Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),So Fun Firestorm Red, If you love to drive and your not carrying more than a passenger next to you then this is a superb handling ride at a great price.I could not get out of this car the first two days of ownership. Limited availability but if you find one you like and aren't so concerned about color then buy it. They go fast out the door. I traded my lumbering gas guzzler Tacoma 4X4 and don't have any regrets. took two trips. One to Tucson from Phoenix mostly highway some city and got 33.4 mpg. Then on the second day I got 35.5 mostly highway with a/c on the whole time. That's better than my Yaris! I suppose the aerodynamics help. The seats a snug but comfortable. The pioneer stereo cranks.,4.75
26, on 07/08/16 18:21 PM (PDT),B Hudson ,2008 Scion tC Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Not My First Choice But the Better Choice!," In March 2016, I purchased a damn 2008 Scion tC w/5 speed manual transmission. I do not think highly of the dealership I purchased it from but the car has been a great decision so far. I was not comfortable making yet another purchase on a car over 100k miles. The vehicle had 122k when I purchased it and now it is at 128k. I am surprised the car is in almost flawless condition. The body is in mostly good shape. I can tell the previous owner was not the best driver based on a few dings around the body. The rear bumper clear coat is completely gone. I am estimating that I will have to repaint the rear bumper. The car has been in Florida its entire life and I can tell the vehicle has never been waxed...ever. Dangerous never to wax here. I know Toyota and Honda have questionable paint qualities but waxing it once in a while will help! Since I have owned the vehicle I have flushed the radiator, changed the thermostat (no leaking, no overheating), two oil changes, new tires, new brakes and rotors, throttle cleaning. I plan on replacing the spark plugs soon. The only major mechanical issue with the car occurred a few weeks ago after I performed my brake change. The vehicle lost all oil. After running a check, the oil valve cover casket went out. It does not appear to be a common problem based on what I am told but it does happen. I am estimating I does am right at 30 miles per gallon on fuel, higher than EPA Estimates. I am not thrilled with the acceleration of the vehicle but it gets the job done. The manual transmission is easy to operate, mostly smooth shifting. Because of the electronic throttles they use in cars now, there is a slight lag on second gear, be prepared for it if you leave the car off for hours and start driving. The sound system is great, I wish the car had Satillite Radio which may end up installing myself. Except for the basic maintenance I just mentioned, the vehicle has required little maintenance! I would recommend using HID headlights instead of the factory headlights. The factory lights have a limited range. Expect to fill up with $30. Do not expect a racing machine from the tC but it is a fun car to drive, comfortable, not cramped for a two door. I would never bother driving the 4 speed automatic version of this car as it would be boring and full of problems. Stick with the manual, be gentle on it and it will be reliable for a long time.",5

I'm not sure if there was a better deal out there when I purchased this vehicle, but it provided the best balance between price, style, performance, and reliability (knowing that it came from the Toyota family of brands). Still in great condition, so haven't had to do anything except the usual maintenence as suggested by Scion.

The TC offers outstanding value for the price.You'd end up paying 3-4k more in other cars for the same features that are present in the TC - all with Toyota reliability. This car is more about a balance of features rather than pure muscle. Despite it's modest engine, it handles well.As a bonus, the TC was made for modders. If you're a modding junkie, and have the money, the TC is your car. Drawbacks - its underpowered - it has a Camry engine. It's peppy in the lower RPM's, but doesnt have true muscle. Its rear door is a pain. The gas mileage is somewhat lacking for a 4 cylinder.But if you can look past these negatives, then the TC is for you. ",4

I guess this is the real cost of having this vehicle being priced quite low in comparison to other similar vehicles.  I do question why a manufacturer would put tires with a tread wear rating of only 160 on a vehicle, the cost of adding better tires would only increase the cost of the vehicle by a couple of $100!

Acceleration can be very strong if you stomp the gas, but then you pay for it next time at the gas station. That may be the biggest thing I'd change if I could help design the next tC update...I think the transmission should include one more gear - a good overdrive to improve gas mileage.

After owning a real car, I realized how awful this one is. It accelerates like a bloated whale. Because it’s a corolla with 3700lbs of garbage in it. Even with no power, it still only gets 21mpg combined. That’s pathetic. It only has two airbags. The seats are covered in an awful mesh that feels terrible. The center console is straight out of a corolla and equally as useless. Gearbox is clunky and began to lockout gears at 135k miles. Clutch is whatever. Just a corolla clutch. Electric throttle is unresponsive. The alternator core failed at 142k miles, right around the same time it sprung three large oil leaks. The trunk is electronic release for some reason. So if it doesn’t fall off which it does often, when the battery or alternator fail you lose your trunk. Rear seats might as well not exist. No room back there for anything. Cheap plastic dash means lots of rattles at higher miles. The dash cluster is a nice blue. I like that. But the indicator lights are a blinding white, so at night the high beams work great but you still can’t see because the high beam indicator blinds you. I had to put duct tape over it so I could actually see in low light conditions. CV Joints failed twice in 30k miles. Burns oil like mad. The car imo looks nice. It’s really disappointing that a car that looks so nice is so awful. If you’re on the market for a cheap economy car, just buy a corolla.

Pros are it is fun and sporty to drive. It is a cheap sports car that is good on gas and reliable. We have replaced only the brakes thus far and normal maintenance. It currently has 120K miles. It is of average comfort. The cons are it is cheaply made. Any little thing that has touched it has left a dent. Also the paint on the side mirrors started chipping off in fall of 2007. The paint on the body is fine but the paint on the side mirrors is now 50 % gone. The rear handle to the hatchback broke completely off after 4 yrs. The sunroof button has to be tapped now to close the sunroof completely. Good overall.,3.75

Front seats don't go back to original position when accessing the back seat. Fun to drive tho and fairly roomy for a coupe, great on gas (avg 27 mpgs for me).

However it is basically a toy. It is kind of like the old honda civics that were made to play with. Parts easily pop off and on for accessorizing, which is lots of fun. The trunk is poorly made, if you live in New England like I do, and it snows it is very difficult to lift the trunk, so you need to clean all the snow off before even trying. Sometimes the trunk ( with no snow on it ) closes by itself and hits you right in the head.

The vent fan squeals and sometimes has stopped (that's fun in the blazing summer). Our breaks needed to be replaced at 33k miles and we don't drive hard or jam our foot into them. The tires are low profile and develop breaks in the sidewall radials easily if a hole or other bump is hit just right. The tires are also expensive and don't gain traction well on wet pavement and easily break loose. With continued use the seats don't stay in place when slid forward when accessing the back seat.",4

At first I loved everything about the car but the more I used it the more I realized how little space was actually available in it. It has a great 4-cylinder engine that is quicker than you would expect. The ride is a little rough and the seats are not very comfortable. However, the interior visually is very appealing. One note: I got the Scion Sirius installation when I bought the car--big mistake! The radio flashed the antenna and neither the dealer or Scion could help.

I have many suggested improvements, but the car is in my opinion much better than the Civic (my brother owns one and I have driven it in comparison) or any other car in the market. My main suggestion is that if you are getting a manual transmission to be aware that a new set of tires would be a great investment due to its ability to peel out easily. ",4.875

The car that always seemed to stand out was the Scion tC.  What put the tC over the top for me was the Release Series 2.0. The color is awesome and the alcantara seats are just as great. Mechanically, the car is solid. It's definitely not a sports car, but drives extremely smoothly and quiet. Its handling is OK, but accurate. There is a lot more room on the inside than it looks. The back seats have tons of leg and hip room, but the head room is a little lacking.  This is a great daily driver that gives you what you need and some stuff you want without costing a ton.

It's great fun to drive, handles well, and I adore its looks. I got a rear spoiler, which improves its looks even more. I drive to work every day, and living in a city a coupe comes handy. Of course it could use a little more torque or hp (well, most cars could), but I would like to point out that I often find myself making turns on the highway at over 60 mph.

I am surprised as to why ratings here are so high! Every TC owner I know has these issues. Moon-roof motor died within first year, they replaced it, then again the second, I had to pay for that, and then again the third year, by which time, I didn't want, a yearly, $1000 fee to use the Moon-roof 4 months out of the year. That is $250/month!The gasket that seals the hatch/trunk door had melted by 3rd year and there is no ownership on dealership's part for this low quality rubber's use. After few winter/summer cycles, you will have this issue and your trunk becomes unusable regardless of the outside temperatures. Trunk release switch cover is even worst, it literally melts into the plastic contrition that sets the release. It was very painful to get all the rubber out of the switch, now running without the cover, so the switch is operational, but, due to exposure to the elements, it died, and had to replace it, but second one melted too, so had to do the same. Removing that melted rubber is neither fun nor quick!The engine, on average, burns 1 quart every 1300 miles! This can get real expensive, especially if you using good, fully synthetic oil. Apparently, this amount is well under their limits! There are no regulations or laws, so companies can set their own limits internally as to what constitutes ""excessive""!",2

Things I liked:Fun car to drive for a ToyotaGreat car to learn/relearn manualVery flexible so easy to haul big thingsThings I didn't like:Not very good in rain/snowTires wore out too quicklyMileage would go down unless driven perfectly on a perfect road  Very bland handlingToo much body rollNo LSDToo high a center of gravityBoth tuner and regular maintenance parts are expensiveThis car only looks sporty and definitely doesn't drive or handle that way. There is way too much body roll and the suspension is way too soft to handle corners. The gear ratios are also very short and the car is desperate for a sixth gear. Even for a commuter car, the car was laughably pathetic in the rain and even more so in the snow. I currently drive a RWD Camaro and the Camaro is laughably better in the snow even without winter tires. All in all, if all you plan on doing is going from A to B, relearn/learn manual or want something stylish, then the car is worth it. But if you're looking for a fun small car, a tuner car, or if you live in the northeast don't bother. I bought this car after having a 97 Civic for 9 years and the Civic was a laughably better car in terms of handling, structural stiffness, gas mileage, and tire wear regardless of how or where I drove; be it the freeway or at the race track. The car got totaled after it hydroplaned in the rain on the way to work. I was only going 40 and I couldn't believe how badly the car was damaged after hitting a guard rail; the first responders told me I was lucky as they see these cars crumple like a can in very small accidents. Buying parts for these cars, be it brake pads, a new clutch or performance parts was also far more expensive than I realized. Same parts for my Honda and even my Camaro are only a fraction of the price. Like others, the paint started wearing off within a year. My biggest complaint was the gas mileage. For such a small car, the mileage was laughable; it would only mirror the EPA estimates if I drove unreasonably slow in on a perfectly smooth road. I got far better mileage in my Civic and even better mileage in my V8 Camaro regardless of how I drive. I really expected a lot more from Toyota.",3

As is, it's pretty tossable, but I'm probably going to get an aftermarket rear sway bar to help flatten things out.  I love the flexibility, if not the total horsepower, of the engine.  It's smooth, torquey and quiet.  Exactly what I've come to expect from Toyota.  The transmission has good ratios, but could be smoother.  6 speeds would be nice.

R&T tested both cars in the year they were produced, the tC was 7.8 to 60, the Supra 7.9. The car handles like it's on rails, the stock tires are very good. The build quality is very good, but there is a rattle in the dash when it's cold (surprise...). Driveability is extremely good. Except for being a little taller and being FWD this car is as much a blast as my '85 Corolla GTS was. The stock sound system is good, better speakers like Quarts make it excellent. ",4.5

It's an all around great car and when it comes to durability, the fact that it's a Toyota speaks for itself. It has some pretty good power thanks to Toyota's modifying the Camry engine to boost the torque. The only complaint that I have are the following: the sunroof rattles (Toyota mechanics were baffled and couldn't fix it), it has loud engine noise, the seat material is cheap and uncomfortable, it has ultra-cheap side mirrors and sunroof cover, and finally... the paint and interior plastic scratches easily.

I put this car on the road twice and the ride was perfect for going out of town on the highway. The car comes with the same 2.5 L engine as the Camry trims and the cargo space is pretty big for a car this size. Love the push to start button (which is a rare feature on an entry car starting around $20k) and you can lock and unlock the 2016 model with your hand and thumb and never have to take your keys out of your pocket. The car comes with scheduled maintenance for the first 25k miles which is a major plus. The TC is not going to be rebadged as a Toyota and not sure what is going to happen to the residual value but the XB was discontinued last year and they still hold their value pretty well and scion cars are low production so the supply should match the demand in the used market.

Don't buy this car if you are looking for a sports car. It's not. Buy this car if you are looking for a much more attractive looking 2-door Corolla with a tiny bit more juice and a lot of extras. For only a couple thousand dollars more than the Corolla, the decision was easy for me. The only reason I gave it a 4 performance wise is that it seems like Toyota markets the car as 'sporty'. Sporty looking/feeling yes, but not a sports car. For commuters, the performance would easily be a 5. Nothing wrong with it. ",4.5

The 2011 is a bit larger with more interior room and the six speed automatic transmission makes it more fun to drive in the sport mode.

334, on 03/09/16 14:45 PM (PST),JMC ,2014 Scion tC Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (2.5L 4cyl 6M),More than meets the eye.," My particular model is a 2014 with a Six-speed manual. I have had it since the late spring of 2014. My choices were down to three cars: the 2014 Corolla S manual, the Scion FR-S and the tC. My criteria was relatively simple, first it HAD to be a manual. Secondly, it had to have decent cargo room. During my test drives, the Corolla was crossed off. While it is a good car with some incredible features and nice looks, Toyota gears the manual paired with its 1.8L more for fuel economy, so the gear range is spaced rather widely apart and I wasn't as keen on its very high revving engine. The FR-S had good performance and very good gear selection. But while it is a good car for somebody who can garage it during the winter, it doesn't make the most practical machine where my average commute to work is about 20 miles and measurable snowfall is a possibility from November to May. So I settled on this. As a plus, the tC is a hatchback, which I prefer to trunks.Performance-wise, it is not an FR-S, but the power to weight ratio of the car is very good for its size. The 2.5L engine is the exact same unit found on the Camry and it is the closest thing to a bullet-proof engine you can find. Problems with this powerplant are very rare and it has a 10,000 mile oil change interval with Synthetic oil from the factory. It uses a timing chain instead of a belt, so it will easily go over 100,000 miles with only the chain tensioner needing to be adjusted once in a while (all this meaning lower cost of maintenance). The shift throws feel very good, as does the clutch pedal. Because it is a front wheel drive, it tends to under-steer a little bit while under power, but you can still drive it like a knucklehead if you wish to. At the same time, it calms down nice for long road trips. Gas mileage is not as good as a Camry even with the same engine due to how it has been geared, but if you stick to non-ethanol regular gas and/or premium it hits the target MPG numbers nicely. In my case, short shifting helps to gain a little more MPG in the city, so I tend to average right around 29.5 to 30 MPG for my mixed road commutes (even with the AC on and going full blast).Seat comfort is very good IMHO, mainly because Toyota put about the same amount of padding in these seats as the Camrys and what I like most is I have enough room to stretch out and adjust my posture in the seat a little during long drives. By comparison the FR-S seat, while comfortable, is form fitting like a fighter cockpit and I can only tolerate that for so long. Rear seat comfort is excellent  As for the factory Pioneer sound system... put it on the ""Powerful"" setting and it will make you feel like you are in a live concert. Trust me, include testing out the sound system as part of your test drive and it will probably win you over. Others might complain about the interior and dash being ""cheap plastic"" but I will give Toyota credit, after two years of use it has not developed any rattles or squeaks. Road noise is not excessive in my example and I like how the engine sounds at highway speeds. After 10 years of use, it will probably be the same. One extra I splurged for during purchase was the BeSpoke Audio, which gives me Aha and a factory navigation system. Aha works well, but I seldom use the internet radio because it is a real data hog. Instead, I have nearly 3000 tunes loaded onto two memory sticks, which I alternate in the standard USB port. The navigation feature works great and is easy to understand/use.I have only encountered two drawbacks with my tC. First, the nose sits a little low, so be careful if you go up a steep driveway or park near a curb to avoid scrapes. Secondly, while the tires are good for all-season use, major snowfall or snow with ice underneath can cause problems as they are NOT snow tires. You can get around, but plan your driving route accordingly. If you go for a used tC, the 14 through 16 models are pretty much identical for the most part. The 16 adds a smart key with push-button start and a rear window wiper (both first offered on the 2014 limited production Monogram series tC). I am considering trading in my 14 for a 16 so I can get these features. The 16's radio has a 7 inch touch screen and to do it, they sacrificed the CD player. In my case, it should be possible to swap in my 2014 radio since the 16 doesn't have a backup camera. Other than that, the engine, wheels, body, moonroof and interior are identical. If you shop for used, get a Certified one with a good maintenance history and the added warranty coverage (it will likely have new tires as well). A new one will give you standard Scion Boost/Toyota Care with 2 years, 25,000 mile paid maintenance. Not sure what Scion going away in 2017 will do to resale values, but mechanically the car is as solid as any Toyota and can last decades with proper maintenance while looking good as well.",5

I was lucky to get something a little more than that. The 2014 tC has seen a pretty drastic exterior styling change from 2013, and while some say its bland (how?), I think it's just what this car needed. The lines are sharp and aggressive, and takes several styling cues from the F-rs. While the front grille and rear diffuser are nice, it really is a bit too much plastic. The wheels are also very nice. The interior is very well laid out, and the standard touch-screen display is great, but again, a little too much plastic. The ride is pretty good for its class, the acceleration is good, and the steering is above avg.",4.25

Great backseat room, nice radio (little hard to learn how to use it at first.) Comfortable. I did drive it on the worst road I have driven on in 50 years and thought it would break, but it didn't.

Since my wife and I ride together to work and the kids are grown, we decided on a coupe. Choices were the TC, Honda Civic and Hyundai Veloster. The Civic was comparable in gas mileage but was $3K higher. The Veloster was better in gas mileage by 5 miles/gal and was comparable in price for the base. But the TC had much more power due to its 2.5L 4-cyl. The front passenger seat has so much room it leaves ample space for a rear passenger up to 6' (my wife is 5'6""). In my opinion, it also looked better than the Civic and the Veloster. Our avg. mileage in the city and highway has been 28 mpg.UPDATE: After 2 1/2 years of owning the car, the materials proved to be inferior. The front shroud of the engine bay came loose and rattled and chattered. The dealer was never able to fix. I ended up using 6 self tapping screws. The water pump went out at 30K  but can still smell antifreeze to this day. Dealer says it is residual from the leak but still smell after engine cleaning. Interior plastics have scuff marks everywhere and wont come off, even with Wipe New. The condensation reservoir for the ac gets clogged every few months and leaked into the passenger front carpet.  The drain hose must be disconnected and cleaned every few months. Dealer says this is normal. Traded the car for a Silverado pichup last month since gas is cheaper now.",3

Even in the snow, I live in northern New Jersey and with just my typical all weather tires, I can get through the snow pretty well with taking my time. This honestly is the best car a young person can buy, I certainly got my moneys worth from it. The only thing I can complain about is the acceleration. It has the sporty look to it but drives more like an economy car, so its a little deceiving. Gas mileage is pretty good. But all in all, a great overall vehicle, VERY RELIABLE!

The car handling is excellent, it feels like you are driving the car not the other way around.

There is not a ton of trunk space but if you are not using the back seats they easily lay down and your trunk space is doubled.

This car has a lot of torque for a 4cyl and moves pretty fast. I would say that the fuel economy is rather low for a 4 cyl and notice that on the freeway, i ride at around 3,000 rpm constantly. Maybe a 5 gear for automatic would have been a good option for the fuel economy. Also, when you gas it for speed, it doesn't take off right away, but does build up speed very fast. Love the moon roofs, and just the over all feel. Other thing I notice is at 70 mph, on freeway, I hit a bad patch of road that made my car feel like it was bouncing. Not a big deal, but was very noticeable. Over all I love it.",4.875

The basic stereo sounds quite decent and the tiny sub actually does a decent job of filling in the lows. Make sure to hold the SSP button for 5 seconds and change the mode from Tc (xB sounded best to me).  The car feels plenty strong for normal driving and takes hills happily.  Only cons I can think of so far are that the steering wheel sits a bit low (or the seat is high) and sits a bit too far forward so either it's a bit far from you or the pedals are too close.  The clutch also has unusually long travel which is a bit odd.  Overall I am very happy, looks and drives great!",4.5

Everything stated before applies and then some.  The US version has 17"" wheels and 225mm width tires.  The result is a more stable ride on the freeway.  Drives on the freeway like my 1988 Mustang GT with 245mm tires on 16"" wheels.  Very stable, very composed.  Standing start acceleration is not a strong suit with this vehicle, but freeway performance is another matter.  In my area, we have freeways with long uphill grades.  The I/M can actually accelerate uphill and in 6th gear! Cruises at 75 to 80 easily!!!!  In 6th gear, engine is only turning 3000 rpm.  The car is very quiet at speed and comfortable.  The seats have large bolsters and are snug, but still very comfortable.  The driver's seat is 6-way manual adjust and don't feel the need for a power seat.  We typically keep cars over 10 years and over 100,000 miles.  I am very confident this vehicle will meet these milestones.",5

Well my salesperson pulled one up and I drove it and found out it was quite easy to drive. Well I went home and mulled it over and went point by point vs. the used xd. After comparing everything I decided on the I'm!  My salesperson got me a great price and they dealer traded for my electric blue. Went in the next night, drove the blue one, got a good deal n my trade and drove home with my beautiful blue car. I love hatchbacks and I especially love toyotas. I have only had her for a week but n my suburban short trips driving I am averaging 33 mpg. I am very happy Toyota will be keeping this model, if they weren't, I wouldn't have bought it. So far it fits my needs and I love to drive it. It is low to the ground but I too am a senior citizen, but I am dealing with that issue. I do wish it had a CD player but I'll have to put my CDs on something else so I can play my tunes going down the road. A sunroof would be nice in this but not an option, hopefully Toyota will add that. I think the inside is very nice, much nicer than many other cars I took on test drives. If you live in a suburb of Chicago head over to oak brook Toyota in westmont and ask for Samantha. Would highly recommend her and the dealership. I wanted to update my review after 6 months, I still love my car! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new car.Well it's been a year with my little blue and I still love her! Went on multiple Midwest trips last summer and she drove like a dream.  I'll be heading to door county again this summer with her and I expect great mpg again and a beautiful trip.

410, on 01/27/16 14:53 PM (PST),Mark ,2016 Scion iM Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (1.8L 4cyl CVT),"Ignore the ""pro"" reviews", Most of the pro reviews dis the iM for various reasons but I've found it to be a great little car.  Chances are you're not going to drive your car at the track or through a slalom so why be so concerned with the acceleration and cornering?   Acceleration is good from the 1.8L - if you want a car that jerks your head back off the line this isn't it (go buy a mustang or camaro).   Handling and cornering are good and road feel is great.  The car feels solid and responds accordingly.  The interior looks pretty good considering it's cloth and soft-touch plastic.   All controls are reasonably located and easy to use.  A tall person (over 6 foot) will not like the rear seat as the aerodynamics of the roof takes its toll on rear seat headroom.  A drop-down console in the middle of the rear seat is great for passengers.  Bluetooth connection to my phone is flawless.  I'm seeing 41 mpg on flat highway and averaging 35 mpg around town (mix of city and hilly suburban driving).,5

This is really a very competent vehicle.  Roomy and comfortable, the side windows and rear do not slope down as they do in the Ford Focus/Volvo S40.

I packed a roll-around luggage piece the size of a golf bag with no problem positioned sideways across the rear compartment (could easily take 2 golf bags).  Had to fold seats down in the Volvo.  The manual shifter is spring-loaded and took awhile to get used to, but got the hang of it quickly (right-hand drive no less).  Performance with a 6-speed and the smaller engine was adequate.  Gas mileage was quite good (over 35 mpg).  Seating is comfortable and passengers noted the roominess for a smaller vehicle.  The driver's seat has height adjustment, and although the front window does slope steeply, there was plenty of headroom.

She wanted me to test drive it before she bought it. I thought it would be sluggish, BOY WAS I WRONG! This car has pep in it's step. Drives better than a V6, I think. 99% of new cars nowadays feels like a temporary car. The quality of the XB feels like 10+ years of ownership. The drive and flow feel tight and sturdy. People giving it crap for its drive needs to STHU. This car is under $20K, what do you expect? Interior room is shockingly roomy. I don't like all the crap my mom put on it.

For a toaster on wheels it is not that bad. The 08 has the rounded corners, didnt like the square styling. I heard some issues about heavy oil consumption.

439, on 03/30/11 09:17 AM (PDT),woodywrkng ,2008 Scion xB Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 5M),"Some good, some bad"," I bought my 2008 XB used, with 26k miles at around 25 months old.It's a 5-speed model, and was at a dealership for a very nice price, perhaps because most people don't drive cars with manuals these days.Most of these Scions are holding their value very well, so it was hard to pass this one up.I'm a 50 year old guy, who's now more interested in a roomy, economical, and reliable car, than one which I hope will impress people.I've owned it for over one year now, and have some good impressions, and some not so good.Driving experience:The car handles and brakes surprisingly well.The suspension is very simple and should prove rugged and reliable.The steering ratio is quick, the turning radius short, and the suspension quite firm without being harsh.The driving position however seems at odds with the handling prowess of the car.From the drivers seat, it just doesn't feel particularly sporty.There are minimal seat adjustments, decent but not well bolstered seats, and a rather high mounted shift lever, with the end result just feeling a bit awkward if you try to drive in too agressive of a manner.While the seats are indeed better than most I found in this price/class of vehicle, it would be nice for a lumbar control or lower seat angle adjustment.The drivers seat will raise and lower, but it's pivoted at the front, thus when raised you tip forward.On the highway it's surprisingly quiet and composed for an econocar.One odd problem I've found is when wearing my size 11 work boots, my left toe rubs on the clutch pedal lever unless I pull my leg back un-naturally, while my right foot can just barely fit between the brake pedal and the center housing to reach the gas pedal.There simply isn't much room under there for an average work boot.My normal shoes don't experience this problem.There's a sizable right rear blind spot, which makes it a crap shoot backing out of an angled parking space, as well as large side view mirrors which obstruct your view to the side.If you tend to drive in nice weather with the window down and your arm hanging out, you may want to begin looking for a decent physical therapist since the window opening is quite high and you'll eventually tear your rotator cuff.Winter driving:The standard tires are round, and that's about it.The traction control works very well, asuming it's working (more later) and it's needed, due to the lame tread pattern of the Bridgestone tires, and very low ground clearance of the car.Many people lower these cars, which should make them a real adventure when encountering a pothole.Speaking of tires, the spacesaver spare is mounted on a wheel, the color of which should be called puke yellow.I reckon that's so you won't be tempted to leave it on for long.There's no discrete vent always aimed at the drivers side window to keep the side view mirror visible on frosty days, so you'll need to aim your dash vent in that direction.The passenger side has a separate vent.Perhaps it's the small wheel wells, but ice tends to form in the front wheel wells and rub on the tires, more than in most cars.Engine:Impressive low rpm punch, acceleration, snort, whatever you want to call it.This thing just plain scoots if you want it to.I do my own repairs, and the normal maintenance items are easy to find under the hood, with the parts that will eventually fail (alternator, water pump, A/C compressor) easy to see and reach.There is some chatter on a Scion forum about leaking water pumps, and mine isn't visibly leaking yet, although there is a pink stripe directly above the pump on the underside of the hood.Gas mileage-wise, I get 23-26 in city winter driving, in the cold state of Iowa, which I feel is fine since my daily commute is only a few miles each way.In warm weather the number rises to 25-28 in town, and up to 35 on a mixture of 55 and 65 mph roads.These figures are when the car is carefully driven however.Transmission:A smooth but long throw hydraulic clutch, widely spaced gear ratios, and a high mounted shifter without a reverse lock result in a car that doesn't ask to be driven aggressively.It took me a few weeks of driving to make nice smooth shifts.People do praise the automatic transmission, but I never drove one.65 mph occurs at 2700 rpm, which is fairly normal for a car like this, although I do feel the car has the power to be geared higher.Interior:I like the blank dash in front of my face when looking straight down the road.Having the instruments slightly to the right gives you an un-cluttered view of where you're going, which is a good thing.A few of the oddities are slightly annoying however.The only clock is part of the trip computer, which has 8 functions.You can only view one at a time, so if you're watching the gas mileage, you don't see the clock.If you could choose which function to view from the steering wheel there would be no problem, but you can't.The standard radio is actually closer to the passenger than the driver, which is a bit odd, and the climate control's temperature knob is behind the shifter knob when in odd numbered gears.Speaking of the standard Pioneer stereo system, it's impressive.I'm an audio nut from long ago, and can honestly say that unless you're a kid wishing to annoy entire neighborhoods with hip-hop, you won't be upset with the sound quality, assuming you learn how to use the various features of the stereo.Most factory stereos in a car of this price are fairly basic, but this one is a nice surprise.Well done Scion.The interior feels cavernous, with easy access (meeting the approval of my 89 year old Mom), backseat legroom like a limo, and enough hard surfaces to create echos.The center console is a few inches too low to be of any use as an armrest, but its storage area is deep enough to hold CDs.The drivers seat has a fold down arm rest, that gets in the way of the seat belt when up, so that's a minor annoyance.There's a storage area under the rear seats, which is a fine idea, except that whatever you putunder there tends to slide around a lot on the hard plastic.I recently loaded a standard sized kitchen range into the rear and closed the hatch, so there is indeed lots of useful space.Exterior:Yeah, it's odd looking, so what?It would be nice to have a key lock for the rear hatch, just in case.The only keyhole on the outside of the car is for the driver's door.The roof is the longest, flattest expanse seen since the early 70's full sized station wagons, which is a good thing since I use an aftermarket roof rack for a canoe or kayak, and the further apart the bars are, the better.The paint seems to be very thin and dainty.It's just too easy to scratch, so you'll be needing a container of touch-up paint, which judging from the price at the Scion dealer, contains precious metals and diamonds.Problems:Being the first year for this model, there are indeed some bugs.Some quite serious and pricy, if they occur after the warranty expires.In my case, my anti-lock brakes, traction control, and stability control are now kaput due to a known problem with a rear wheel speed sensor, and being two months out of warranty, I'm looking at a 700 - 900 dollar repair.And that's only for one of the sensors.Double that number when the other one fails.It seems as though they aren't waterproof.Scion knows about the problem, there's a TSB on it, but chooses not to issue a recall or an extended warranty on this issue.Since it concerns most of the safety functions of the car, I find that disturbing.There are also issues with the water pump, electric power steering, windshield cracking, and an assortment of creaks and groans to name a few.Overall, I'm basically pleased with the car, but disturbed by the reliabilty concerns.It reminds me of the Ford Fiestas from the late 70's, on a larger scale, but without the simplicity and reliability.

In the others cars, I was either staring into the sun-visor or hunching over to see out of the front window. The Xb also has enough back seat and cargo room for traveling with my kids, a worry I had in giving up the SUV. On a recent trip, we fit four suitcases and three bags of golf clubs in the back.

But just like modern bands, you switch a member here and there, and before you know it the name Scion doesn't mean what it used to mean. Take the xB for example, the old one was great, small engine, loads of room. Sure it could have used a bigger engine, but fuel mileage for space was what counted. Then they messed with the image, put a bigger engine, but also a bigger chassis. The result is a car that is no longer what it used to be.

It has 107,000 miles on it and I've had no major mechanical problems with it. Just the usual maintenance. I've had to replace the exhaust gasket twice already, minor. I've also had to replace the engine belts twice due to squealing.  The only things that I've had problems with are the power door locks will stick if someone tries to open the doors as you are hitting the unlock button.  The cd player also gives me trouble, it wont eject the cd when I press the button, I have to keep pressing it multiple times and it finally spits it out with alot of grinding sounds.. I remember bringing it to the dealership within the first 3 years because the ipod plug was giving me issues. These problems don't bother me enough to fix in a 10 year old car unless they stop working completely. I've also had to replace my windshield twice, this model has some sort of design flaw which places stress on the windshield causing it to crack. By reading other reviews, I seem to be lucky to only have replaced it twice.  This car is super roomy, lots of rear leg room. I can fit large pieces of furniture in it, bureaus,dryers, a washing machine.  It has high seats, feels like you're sitting upright in a chair. Great visibility all around. I have a roof rack so I throw a 13 foot canoe on top of it very frequently. I also love the tow hooks you can install on the bumpers! Very handy for tying down the canoe!   My only complaints are the weak engine, I also will not pull out in front of cars as it has no pep on take off. The front seats have no lower back support, very uncomfortable for long trips. No cruise control, also not convenient for long trips. I personally think the pros outweight the cons with this vehicle.

Someone loved it and ran a carfax on it. To his dismay it said that it had around 350K on it at the time he bought it, which leads to the fact that someone turned the odometer. Anyway - He has owned it 4 yrs and still owns it. He has never had to put any work into it other than the normal maintenance. This car currently is 10 yrs old and has over 400K miles on it and just keeps on ticking. I am just amazed what a phenomenal little car this is despite the mileage issues. I just had to rave on my sons behalf!!! OH! There is one thing that was bad with the car and that was the back latch which I guess is a history on this car breaks.

These cars do not go accelerate fast with the a.c. on going up a mountain, but the $30.00 to fill up the tank is the payback. I get around 37 mpg up here in the mountains of New Mexico.

I go past everyone in my xB and they have twice the engine, they just drive like slugs because they bought big hoggish cars and they are disgusted with the driving experience.

My wife averages 31 mpg in daily commuter driving including stop-and-go traffic. The interior feels cheap and the ride is stiff. You sit very high for a small car which improves visibility. Not much power from the 1.5 liter engine but who cares with that gas mileage. Very cheap to purchase new, only costing $15,000 with the optional cruise and armrest. The rear liftgate is the entire height of the car so its a bit awkward to open. The cruise control is awful to use as it drops 3 to 5 mpg before engaging, but once it does it works fine. This is the best car for the money and thats why the resale is so high",3.625

Very, very uncomfortable on long trips -- 3 hours plus.  I do enjoy driving it locally  -- easy to park, brakes work well, low maintenance, etc.  But at 27,000 miles, my tires are just about worn out.  I have rotated the tires every 3 to 4,000 miles.

VSC compliments the ABS, EBD & TRAC control. The shape makes it look lower than what it actually is (measure it!). It has the same ground clearance as my Corolla). VERY good in snow I run all season tires all the way around and if the snow is substantial I'll lower the tire pressure on the front tires to 26lbs and it's super stable and tracks great.

Forget about this being a ""youth"" car, I'm 46 and I love it. I also got the manual, and it's so fun to drive! I bought it on e-bay, and drove it from CT to IN, 1,000 miles w/no problems.

The reason is because of the price, the fuel economy 31MPG city and 34MPG highway and the ways you can trick it out. Who would have thought that you could get a brand new vehicle for only $13,000 and trick it out and it would only cost you about $21,046. You can trick out the rims the exaust pipe and audio system to about 2000 watts of power.  The name ""Scion"" is actually a low priced Toyota aimed ay young buyers.

Naturally expect to pay a premium for rarity and extra feature only on orange xB, referred to as RS1's (relese series 1).  I have a 5-speed (which tends to be harder to find in general among all Scions). Acceleration is average with the 5-speed. Below average with the auto (adds 1.5 sec to 0- 60 time).

The car has a great look and is eye pleasing.  In fact the only problem other than outside noise when driving is everyone looking at you.  That may not be a bad thing for some people.  If you decide to put on 18 inch or 19 inch rims make sure you put on super tires.  This can really cause a rough ride on bumpy roads or cause your rims to bend if tires are cheap.

The cargo space is very adequate for 90% of what I need to carry.  Although the stock configuration is under powered, I have managed to make it acceptable by adding the optional Cold Air Intake.

635, on 12/06/15 15:25 PM (PST),Howard Ferstler ,2015 Scion xB Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 4A),"Hey, we now own TWO of the things!"," We purchased our first one (light, metallic silver color) back in September, trading in an 11 year old Scion xA model that had performed superbly, but was a tad too small for serious long highway work. The new xB is excellent for serious long highway work, and is a REAL car instead of a pint-sized runabout like the xA. I love everything about the car but the 4-speed audio, since it tends to ""hunt"" between 3rd and 4th gear at speeds below 45 mph on hilly roads. However, while the Scion owner's manual has nothing but cryptic info about the ""S"" transmission mode (the standard choice would be the ""D"" mode), I have discovered that if you leave it in that mode (which allows for manual shifting, but also shifts automatically on up to 3rd gear) the hunting ceases. Use the ""S"" mode for moderate-speed city driving and you will do fine. The transmission is probably responsible for the only so-so gas mileage but it is probably bulletproof in terms of reliability, just like the engine (which was used as the standard Camry engine until 2011). Anyway, last week we purchased a SECOND xB, trading in our ten-year-old xB, which had been as solid and reliable as the xA first traded. This new one (bright white in color) has the same features (including the 4-speed auto), and seems to run as well. The older xB and xA models had manual transmissions, and it did not take long for us to discover that switching back and forth between the old xB and the new xB required more mental-operation work than we (wife and I) old timers could deal with. Now, both of our cars operate the same way. Right after I got the first one I replaced the ugly plastic hubcap stock wheels, and I will be doing the same thing with the newer one this week. I hate hubcaps, and particularly hate plastic ones. Ugh! Whatever, both cars are terrific and if they are as reliable as the two previous models we will be driving them for a long time.",5

After selling my 2011 xB in 2015, I missed it very much.  Bought a Mazda CX-5 (nice car but not a fit for me)  :)  So------------sold it and found a 2015 xB which I purchased in Feb. 2017.

637, on 11/21/15 07:17 AM (PST),DJC ,2015 Scion xB Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Great value.," It's too bad the xB is being discontinued.  It's a good value that with a few improvements would be phenomenal.  We are a family of 3 and this is a good alternative to a crossover.  The pluses include fantastic use of space, comfortable seats, and punchy acceleration.  You can pack this car easily for vacation or road trips.  The sound system is great.  A few improvements that I would suggest include, mediocre fuel economy and an outdated transmission.  They're likely related.  With another gear or two mileage would improve as would passing on the highway.  Acceleration around town is great though.  Lastly Edmunds complaints about the center mounted gauges is just silly.  Not destracting at all.  To sum up this is a great car for a small family who needs some versatility, but not a big SUV.",4
638, on 11/08/15 14:46 PM (PST),Scott Davis ,2015 Scion xB Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Big interior and Great Price," Just purchased 2015 Scion xB and I am averaging 29.3 MPG for the first 3500 miles on the road.  The vehicle is a manual transmission model.  Not sure why others are reporting poor MPG.  I live in the midwest with very few hills  and I have a manual transmission so perhaps that might be the reason.  Plenty of stop and go traffic and some highway driving and still achieve 29 MPG. I actually like the center gauges. At night I do not have the annoying gauge lights below me while viewing the road.  It is quite easy on the eyes.  Also the digital speedometer is a big plus over dial gauge.  We place an iPad on the passenger side dash and lays there flat nicely.  I am a 6'4"" person and this vehicle is unbelievably roomy (headroom and leg room are stellar) even in the back seat. I initially was not keen on the boxy look of the vehicle but after tinting the windows and installing fog lights myself the exterior is very appealing.  I have several comments on the look and the BIG interior.  Reliability with Toyota Camry engine should be well above average.  I do not observe the road noise as others have stated.  I looked at a Kia Soul.  You will be very disappointed in the interior size. Very small. Initial features of the car are not great. Get the vehicle for $17K with no options and then add aftermarket or the Toyota options yourself.  They are available at lower prices from online Toyota dealers.",4

This is the smoothest and quietest car I have ever owned and this is my 43rd car. Acceleration is great and transmission is so smooth I never feel it shift. Being an older driver I find the seating position and easy of entry and exit to be great. Cargo capacity is better that the RAV4 that I replaced with this Scion. Dollar value is exceptional,5

In short for potential buyers: The XB is as reliable as the sunrise and more practical than a minivan for daily operation and frequent trips. It's not fast, 0-60 happens in 9 seconds flat, with the manual, which isn't as bad as you think considering the weed wacker under the hood. Seats 5- 'comfortable with each other' individuals, or four NBA STARS. Headroom and rear storage space is unmatched and un-believable in a car that can get 40mpg while remaining fun, stylish, (if you're into the look) and reliable. It takes turns like any other fun small car would despite the high seating position but low clearance, and throttle response is instantaneous. Oh yeah, AND it does snow fine. Here's MY experience with the xB. In my years, it's  never broken down or failed to start once, basic maintenance, original engine and 5 speed manual after 277,000 miles and it STILL does not feel like it's worn out. Think about that for a second. This car has gone to Saturn's rings and back, and has had over $14,000 worth of fuel dumped into it and to my knowledge has shown no trouble. I'm not trying to be dramatic, just think about that. Mine, and another I've driven both have the same acceleration and fuel economy. About that, this car may not be fast, in fact it's so slow my 2nd gen Honda Odyssey would gap it in seconds like dog launching off a deck after a squirrel. Even so, the 5 speed makes it FEEL fast or at least fun. It was my first stick and set the standard for literally every other car I will ever own, I mean I'm never owning another automatic besides my Astro and Odyssey. This car is a gem, a gem like you would never know unless you've been with it for 50,000 miles and across half the world pretty much. This car is like a '90s Honda Civic for people who need to haul more stuff or people, both of which this comically shaped car does great. You might not think a box on wheels sounds like a good idea, but think of it as a sub compact van that works in urban areas and returns great economy.  With the rear seats removed, which can be done fairly easily, it's eerie how much you can fit in the back, when you step back and look at the car's size and height. Speaking of a car this size, gas mileage is what you would expect; 30 city, done deal, even if you drive it like I drive it. 35 highway, and chill out and don't pass everyone and you're over 40, easy. Also easy is this car, which being my first manual made it real easy. Clutch is forgiving and simple,  but tight and can be difficult not to squeal the wheels when in traffic on a hill, especially since it's so light. The car itself, is also very light, it feels like it's 2,000lbs even but it's actually 2,600lbs with me inside it. I'm 5'11"" 200lbs by the way, and my neighbor is 6'6"" and fits in the BACK SEAT with room to spare. I wasn't joking about NBA stars. What have I put into it? Less than $500 for about three minor repairs. Rear hatch latch is an electronic button that opens the door, and it WILL break and you will need to replace that. My car having 270k on it with original suspension buckles and bounds whenever I turn in, so replace those shocks, it drives SO much better and more planted. Even with my off road suspension, I feel safe and secure driving it. The worst part about the car is also my favorite part about the car, the manual transmission. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it's here, but it's nothing to write home about. It's not a Honda gearbox and it never will be. It's clunky and doesn't like to be shifted hard and rough like a Honda would. This may not be a 'car enthusiast' car but it can be a car guy car, or a utility car, or a first car, up to you, and considering you can get all this for like $1-4 grand, it's one of my all time favorite cars ever made, and it really is a shame it got publicity over it's appearance rather than it's utility and fun.

The belts systems on these cars seem to be a week point, I can never seem to keep them tight enough to avoid squealing in cold weather. The climate control selector is also a weak point, as it always seems to be a bit loose and inaccurate. The paint chips easily and due to the upright position of the windshield it also tends to attract rock chips. The engine is underpowered and on hills on my way to work it has to work hard and turns 4,000 rpm just to keep up to speed. This is a great in-town car, but is not a great highway/trip car. The XBs do not come with cruise control (really, electric windows, but no cruise control?). They also do not come with a center arm rest, which is needed. Road noise is deafening, which is a shame because the stereo system is pretty good...just can't hear it much on the open road. Driving comfort is grueling for anything more than short jaunts around town. Ride is harsh. Don't get me wrong, this is a very well constructed car, and long lasting.

It now has 250,000 miles on it and runs like a top -- my mechanic can't believe it has that many miles on it. Other than a snapped fan belt four years ago and a starter motor that wore out last year, routine maintenance has been all it has needed: oil change every 3,000 to 4,000 miles, brake pads/tires when needed, one transmission flush, replace an A/C valve, drop in a new battery once or twice, that's been it. The seats are cushy compared with the cardboardy seats of the Hyundai Accent I owned; LOTS of leg room in the back seat, which was surprising; LOTS of head room throughout; great cargo with easily folded-down seats; great road feel with front wheel drive. The speakers sound tinny and it doesn't have cruise control, but it doesn't matter that much. Overall, this is the best car I've ever owned. UPDATE: The stereo system was an add-on that includes a DVD player. I just learned that when the volume is low, THAT is when the stereo sounds tinny. However, when turned up, it sounds great -- all the words of songs are audible, etc. Still the best car I've ever owned.",5

There's plenty of head room and leg room. I also love that there's great space for storage. I take a ton of gear with me everywhere I go and I've never been out of room. I haven't had to do hardly any maintenance on it, other than routine stuff. I did have to replace a belt in it that snapped at one point, but it was an inexpensive and easy fix.

Cruising at 70mph on highway, got 40MPG (240 miles/ 6.2 gals). Interior is roomy and comfy. Cool, or ""cute"" factor is incomparable.

After doing more research on the Xb and finding out this model was first sold in Japan in 2000, it became a popular car. Saw all the great reviews and finally went for the plunge. The unorthodox design of the car reminds me of the compacts you would normally see in Japan. I test drove both auto and manual and was surprised that this compact had decent power.

It handles well and is not as bad in side winds as the body style might suggest.  The ride is a bit stiff and a little bouncy, especially when new.  This improves after several thousand miles, however they should really soften up the suspension just a little, especially in the rear.

I've had my xB going on 1.5 years now and I really enjoy it. I drive in a lot of high traffic areas and I'm positive no full size SUV can match it.  Yeah sure, I can't tow stuff, but I can park anywhere and getting around 30 mpg is a life saver. It's great on lane changes and when you lay the seats down you have a lot of room to carry all sorts of goodies. I've even slept in it twice, no not because I'm a weirdo, but because the tent just isn't as fun as it once was. I had the cold air induction put on and the exhaust added but you really don't get much bang from those mods.  At least it sounds kinda neat. ",4.875

It's small enough to walk around in the garage and to squeeze into parking spaces only a Mini Cooper would look at twice, but big enough to cross your legs, with your hands crossed behind your head...in the back seat.  It's fun enough to drive that it surprises, often all the way into a smile.  It drinks less gas than most vehicles and makes you feel slightly less guilty about the planet you ride upon.  Toyota didn't have to reinvent the wheel for the cB, just smoosh together the best traits of the city car: affordability, a reasonably well-appointed interior, roominess, safety, and it is charming.  This car strikes so many sensible compromises that I am glad to see it loved by ravers and retirees.",4.875

Klinger ,2012 Scion xB Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Scion xB is the Champion of the Boxy Cars!," In terms of overall quality, value, reliability and space, this car is unbeatable.  I should know!  I've owned five (yes 5) of them.  I've owned a 2004, 2005, 2009, 2010 and 2012.  Of them all, I still own the 2004 and 2012.  Surprisingly, the 2012 is the one I am least satisfied with.  Just AFTER the warranty my electric door locks stopped working and Toyota took a ""tough luck"" position on it and handing a several hundred dollar quote to repair them.  This after purchasing 6 Scions and 3 Toyotas over the past 11 years.  I love these cars and their value, reliability, ride and overall quality.  However, now that Scion has discontinued the xB and Toyota has discontinued Scion, I'm thinking I may have to take a ""tough luck"" position with Toyota and look toward Subaru or Honda for my next car. Update. Recently I was involved in a car crash involving my 2004 xB.   I was hit from behind by a huge Dodge hemi truck which was traveling at 50 mph.  Traffic came to a complete stop in the truck did not see me stop. WhIle  sadly my toaster is toast I have a newfound respect for the integrity of my cars.  However:   I am still quite annoyed that my 2012 has door locks that stopped working and Toyota  could care less about me as a customer even after buying all these Toyotas and scions.   I would expect my doorlock to quit so soon on a lesser quality cheaper product on the market. But not a Toyota product. And I would expect crappier  Service and a similar attitude from the lesser brands on the market but not from Toyota. With Scion now dead if this is all better TOYOTA cares about their loyal customers it makes me feel like perhaps I owe them nothing and should look at their competitors for my next car!",5
715, on 11/30/15 16:12 PM (PST),William McCoy ,2012 Scion xB Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Love this Amazing vehicle!," Very recently bought a used 2012 Scion xB Wagon, 2.4L I-4, 16-valve, ohc, 5-spd Manual, to replace my hard-driven '97 Toyota Tacoma Xtra Cab with 221,800+ miles. My Tacoma also had an earlier iteration of the same power plant as the xB. Consumer Reports review for the 2012 xB are all full red dots (excellent) except for Trim/Paint, which was half-a-red-dot (very good). The example I found and bought had been a personal lease vehicle, returned to its original dealership, with only around 15, 586 miles on it; very low for a 2012. I consider myself fortunate to have gotten this car. This is a very dependable, long-used Toyota engine design. Build and assembly quality is very solid. I have yet to put 500 miles on this vehicle, but I absolutely love driving it, and it's getting better as I'm becoming accustomed to the feel and handling.Positives:  Handling: Very quick; sports-car like. Small turning circle accentuates this. Front-wheel drive also accentuates this, tending to understeer because the steering wheels are also the driving wheels.  Cornering: like being on rails; flat, little tip; the boxy shape is deceptively stable. Very wide stance plus low profile; a box with a wheel on each corner. Center of gravity is pretty low; not as low as a Subaru or Porsche, which have boxer engine configurations that lay flat, but it's still great. The I-4 engine is tilted back slightly with the weight approximately centered over the front wheels. Most fun I've had since I first drove a '64 VW Beetle 4-speed.Clutch:  Moderately light; easy to hold; an advantage in LA traffic. A bit grippy in 1st, shift to 2nd quickly and smooths out.Brakes:  As much as I have so far experienced, the 4-wheel discs bring it to a stop really fast. Vented discs in front, solid discs in rear.Gearing:  Surprisingly, what seems to me to be a little low; at 70 miles per hour, I'm running 3,000 rpm in 5th (my '97 Tacoma with same engine but rear-wheel drive, ran 2500 at 70 mph).  However, I can see the logic of the design, because they've tweaked it to be just under its peak torque curve at common highway speeds. You can still accelerate away pretty well in 5th without downshifting. The tach doesn't show redline until 6500 rpm! If gearing were slightly higher, fuel mileage could probably be improved a bit, but it might not be as much fun to drive!Interior:  Nice fit and finish. Little cubby bins everywhere, cup/can holders front and rear.Driver's seat could benefit from an infinitely-adjustable electric design. While this model features tilt-telescope steering wheel, and a six-way manually adjustable seat, the slightly odd driving position within the confines of the ""box"" cry out for more adjustability, particularly with the 5-speed, because of active clutching and braking. Automatic drivers won't care. The manual adjustable seat adjusts seat-cushion angle, seat-back angle, and forward-backward seat position. There is no height adjustment The seat adjustments, plus the steering adjustments mean most drivers can find a combination that is CLOSE to what they want, but they won't be able to make it PERFECT. Many Toyota models without electric seats suffer from this problem.Weakest spot, by far, Scion:  INADEQUATE SUN-VISORS.  The big windows, which contribute to great visibility for most drivers, ALSO puts one's head at a low angle compared to the top line of the windows, thus allowing indiscriminate BLINDING BY THE LIGHT.  A simple fix would be to use sun-visors with those slide-out-the-end panels to extend them the full width of the window, thus keeping our eyes functioning. Don't forget to bring your ""shades"" when you drive, and wear headgear with a bill or brim.Inadequate cargo area lighting:  One little light on the left side of the rearmost cargo area. Low, and manually switched.  Better placed above, inside the top of the hatch frame to spread light over the area.  Flat floor due to front-wheel drive allows for lower placement of space-saver spare, and a ""storage tray"" which rests on top of the spare, but under the floor panel. And in my particular car, carpeted/monogrammed mat on top of that. Storage cubbies around the spare under the floor panel, and open storage bins on right and left side of cargo floor. There was room for more storage on inside of rear roof support pillars, if it had been utilized. In the molded paneling, there are depressions as if some designer thought about making a storage bin, but just didn't follow through with it.As I said, I haven't had this car very long, but I anticipate driving it for a WHILE, and enjoying every minute of it. So far, have seen very few things to criticize.My biggest disappointment was reading in someone else's review that Scion will not be making the xB after 2016—is that right? That's a shame, because it's a great car. Of course, the up side is, that it'll make mine worth more down the road, because it'll still be desirable!!",5
716, on 10/20/15 13:11 PM (PDT),T.C. Howard ,2012 Scion xB Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 4A),I love this car," This is the first new car I've ever purchased for myself.  It was purchased to offset my other car, a 2006 Dodge Magnum with the Hemi, which doesn't get good gas mileage in city driving, but is acceptable on the highway.  At the time of purchase for the Scion, August 2012, I was still working a 9 to 5 job that I am now retired from, and my drive to, and from work averaged about 7 or 8 miles round trip, city driving, and I was getting around 13 mpg in the Magnum.  I am also a musician, and need a vehicle capable of hauling my equipment, which was one reason I bought the Magnum after the van I had died.  I liked the concept of a squared off car, and had looked at a couple of XB's that people at work had bought.  I looked at other small SUV's that got good gas mileage,  and considered the Kia Soul, but it was smaller, and the brand didn't have the reputation for dependability as did a Toyota, which the Scion is.  The price was higher for the Scion, but I figured it would pay for itself with it reputation for longevity, and the extra cargo space.  The car is the base model, but I love the way it handles, and can only imagine how it would handle if I add some improvements like better tires, and suspension parts.  I'm a big person, and weigh over 300 pounds, but can easily get in and out of the car, and the seats are fairly comfortable for me, even on long trips.  This is my ""daily"" driver, and I love this car.  I wish it had a six or seven speed automatic transmission, and all wheel drive option.  I love, and enjoy driving my Magnum, but I have to consciously choose to drive it, which happens about once every two weeks.  My choice for driving is my Scion.  My warranty is out, since it has been over three years, although I only have 27, 000 miles on it.  I understand that the XB will not be made for 2016 which is a shame, as I would consider trading mine in if an upgraded transmission, and all wheel drive were offered.  They apparently will offer nothing but cars/sedans in the upcoming year.  So, I'll make my XB last.",4
717, on 10/08/15 01:05 AM (PDT),Bradley Knisley ,2012 Scion xB Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Just what I was looking for," This was the first car that I bought brand new. I did a lot of research over a couple years to find just what I was looking for. I was at the Cleveland auto show when I sat in the 2012 XB for the first time. It was love at first sight. It now had an arm rest, which is a must and adjustable steering. I love the electronic steering because I work real hard at work and would much rather not fight with the steering wheel after a hard days work. I was looking for a SUV that was good on gas, reliable, could haul just about anything and looked good while doing so. I love the center mounted dash because the steering wheel doesn't get in the way of what you need to see. I upgraded the radio, purchased the cold air intake and TDR muffler. The car felt sluggish to me because I traded in my Jetta turbo for my new XB. This improved the performance and gave it the pep I was looking for. You honestly can fit almost anything in the back of this beast. I purchased a 60 inch TV that fit it in the back, in the box but did have to move the front seats forward a couple inches. I moved everything in my house except for a few pieces of bedroom furniture and my kitchen table. Let's face it, you can not get by with just a sedan being a home owner. This vehicle has meet my expectations and has exceeded them. I look forward to owning this vehicle for many many years.",4

Simple solution is to crack a rear window some. In my case I just crack open the sun roof.  I rated the trans as poor as all it would have taken to greatly improve gas mileage would have been to put an overdrive gear on the thing, like my old Camry used to have.  It's a bit bouncy compared to my Lexus ES, but I enjoy it for other reasons.",5

We have two other small electric cars, so this car is for longer trips/ back up.  I bought #960 out of 2000 of the release 8 series.  It has a lowered body kit and is a cool blue color.  Initially there was HORRIble rattle coming from the windshield whenever I went over bumps.  I found out from the internet that this was the cowl rubbing against the windshield due to inadequate insulation and that it was an easy fix.  I am not mechanical and it was indeed an easy fix.  People online suggested using weatherstripping from home depot to install between the cowl and the windshield.  I used the fuzzy part of a velcro strip which is working well.  It went from sounding like a car with 200,000 miles on it to sounding like a new ride.  I am coming from a minivan, so this car handles well.  On the twisties it handles well for the box that it is.  Anyone who is hung up by the center console or the buzzing sound that the exhaust makes doesn't have a sense of humor.  This is an economy box that has a huge amount of room.  I am 6'2"" with a long torso and I have at least another 8"" over my head.  And my model has a sunroof.  It keeps transportation cheap and simple.  If I drive it hard I can get 22 mpg city.  If I decide to go for good gas mileage I can get 26 city or 38 highway.  I got a great deal certified used.",5

The brakes inspire confidence (4wheel disc with ABS, and EBD). My 2008 averaged 27+MPG mostly city driving. One tank averaged 33mpg on a 300+ mile road trip.

I also wanted a reliable car. Having driven a couple of domestic brands that were always in and out of the shop for recalls that never were completed (sorry, we're waiting for parts), I finally decided to snag a Scion for a good deal.   The car is very spacious. Visibility is so-so thanks to thick pillars forward and back.  I picked the XB over a Kia Soul because the car felt more spacious and was definitely peppier.  Since my last review, the Nav/Entertainment system has had a few glitches where you can't always advance to the next song (you have to restart the car for this glitch to reset.) Voice recognition for nav is temperamental (also doesn't seem to have a way to update the maps).  So far impeccable mechanical reliability with regular oil/filter changes, but I've been thinking about getting a 4WD vehicle for the snowy weather.The interior continues my love/hate relationship. The car is very roomy, but the interior is dark and the C pillars are too thick.For anyone who wants Toyota quality (sadly, Scion is no more, merged back into mothership Toyota) and a unique and spacious vehicle (I still rate the car better than a Kia Soul or Nissan Cube and much more solid feeling than a tinny Honda Element), the Scion XB is a great used car.",4

Approximately 7k miles at purchase, now 10.5k.Over all , I am pleased with the car. I had an issue with noisy, sub par rear disc brakes. Likely due to rotors that had been rusty. Knowing that a dealer would claim no warranty on a "" wear"" item, I put some Akenono pads and medium quality new rotors on the back. Noise gone and better braking.   The next issue was the daytime running lights quit working recently. This is the lower, front corner led strips and the daytime front running/parking light lamps. I took it to a local Scion dealer who claimed that you have to turn the parking lights on for them to work. They claimed that there was no problem. Not so. Always worked before, when ignition is on and parking brake off. Taillights do not illuminate with normal working daytime running. Confirmed with owners and shop manuals. I'll be going back for satisfaction on this repair. To be fair, it is not the Scion dealer that I purchased the car from. ( That's 150 miles away from me). Still, Toyota has always made a point that any dealer will honor their defect warranties.This is the first front wheel drive vehicle I have owned in several decades that does not have an independent rear suspension. Beam rear axle with no sway bar. The body roll is pronounced and excessive and ride quality not real good. Toyota/Scion made a factory accessory ( TRD) sway bar that had evidently been discontinued. Too many noise complaints from squeaky bushings, it seems. Aftermarket rear sway bars seem far too thick for normal road use.I was very surprised when I discovered that the xB does not have an engine coolant temperature gauge. I can't understand how anyone could consider that an OK idea. Only the clueless would not care about that. I can live with the center mounted gauges, but why? Front seats are comfortable. Your right leg is bothered by the center console unless you contort to a specific driving stance. Many have complained about that. Some have even removed the entire center console. Rear seat leg room is generous for the class, but seats are not particularly comfortable. Very upright.The xB does the job of what it really is. A reputably very reliable grocery getter that can haul five people in a pinch. Very good cargo room with rear seats down. Very little cargo room with the rear seats up. ""Parts bin engineering"" with a circa 2004 Camry engine and about a late 90's four speed automatic. At Interstate speeds it is noisy and fatiguing to drive. For local town and country driving it is much more pleasant. It has adequate acceleration at lower speeds. The fuel mileage is not so great, which I knew going in. The four speed automatic and a not very aerodynamic shape are to blame. I average about 24 mpg if driven conservatively. The dash average mpg gauge reads about 2 mpg optimistic.This is the first Toyota product that I have ever owned, although I have driven many of them. You can expect pretty stodgy, ""appliance"" handing and performance from nearly everything they make. ( Excluding Lexus). That said, the promise of reliability is the selling point. This Scion xB is one of the very few Toyota vehicles you can buy that is actually made in Japan. The xB has been discontinued after the 2015 model. I hope that does not overly hurt the resale values . In the past the retained values have been quite good.",4

I needed an inexpensive(ish) vehicle that would comfortably accommodate my 6'3"" frame, with a back seat that would accommodate my three kids. The Xb hit the mark. I bought my Xb for virtually the same price as a Corolla, but had the larger cabin that I needed. Performance is fine. Fit and finish is good. A very easy car to drive and park.

I removed the front bumper cover and straightened out the air pick up and installed a screen where the fog lights would be and the car breathes much better.  This is a great no frills mid sized car.  Very versatile in use and hauling.  As others mentioned the drivers side only arm rest is a joke.  I removed the arm rest and installed a console from a 2011-2015 and the problem is almost solved.

I really like the way it handles. The center gauges are not really a problem. The steering wheel is not telescopic, but the driver's seat has a height adjustment, so there really shouldn't be a problem. The radio plays very well. The A/C is excellent. My only negative comment is it is a little noisy when accelerating, but it has been awhile since I have driven a 4 cylinder vehicle. Overall a great car for the price. Lots of space and very roomy inside. Great vehicle if you have dogs.",4.75

There is zero major maintenance to do on these cars until they get to 100k miles. All you do is keep gas in it, change oil when needed, and drive it!! I've never had to change anything on either of my xB's so far. You're probably thinking...yeah you just keep getting a replacement. Well, why would I keep buying the SAME car as a replacement? Because they work!! Kept the 2008 until it had 72k miles on it. Kept the 2012 until it had 88k miles on it. Never replaced any parts on either of them. Gas, Tires, Air filter, and Oil and that's it. Drive it, drive it, drive it. This car has the best seating position for a large adult of any small wagon on the road. It has the cargo space to haul all kinds of stuff, lots more than a Soul or Cube. And talk about run...this car will run out from under you if you don't have the seat belt on tight!! Solid built car. No fuel filter to replace, no wheel bearings to repack, no transmission fluid to change until you get to 110k miles, no spark plugs to replace until you get to 100k miles. Need I say more??",4

I am 6'3"" and have plenty of headroom.  Legroom for the driver is average.  Front Seat passenger legroom is good.  You can lay the back seats down and haul a bunch.  Peppy engine and sound system is good.  Handles really well.  Toyota Camry engine so it is a reliable engine.The Bad:  - The seats.  Horrible.  Arm rest for the driver is way to low and slender.  Worthless.  The passenger arm rest is... wait, there is NO armrest.  Really??  Only 1 power adapter in the entire vehicle.  The center console is tiny, too low and pretty much useless.  The trim is cheap.  The weather stripping on the driver's side window lost its felt (or whatever it is) and the window bound up on the stripping when lowering it.  Car Max extended warranty would not cover.  Had to take a razor and cut it out, else spend $500 for a new door panel.  The ride is horrible.  You feel every bump.  If you are just using this for a trip here and there around town or for short commutes then it is ok.  I am using for a daily commute and it is abysmal.  There really is no intermittent wiper.  The intermittent setting can't be adjusted so it is just a lower low setting.  There is a horrible blind spot on the passenger side when backing out of parking spaces.  The fenders, hood, etc will dent if a leaf falls on it.  I barely leaned up against it and accidentally dented it.  Overall:  If you want a car for short commutes or a safe car for teen drivers then this is it.  Otherwise buy a Camry or Corolla.",3

The 2.4 engine make the Scion get and go, economy of the car is really see at the low speeds, the automatic trans could use an additional gear, keeping the RPMs around 1.8k when on the highway and would make the Scion that much more economic for highway use, but with a tight engine I got 315 miles on the first out of town trip.  Please do not misunderstand the Scion is good on gasoline",5

The only tires that worked in New York snow were $700 Blizzaks, you're going nowhere with all seasons.

At 111,000 miles repairs started, 3 wheel bearings, water pump, alternator, oil pressure gauge($7). Also replaced light bulbs in headlights about every 50,000 miles, weird. The big issue is the fuel evac canister. 62,000 - 103,000 and again at 156,000 miles it needs to be replaced to pass inspection. This same part in the xB is $250 but the xD is $870!

I had looked at several popular cars (Corolla, Civic, Impreza, etc) and hadn't thought about Scion. I caught sight of it on a used car lot and before I knew it I was signing the papers. The xD is a reasonably priced car that has great fuel economy. I typically will get about 28-32 around town and 32-36 on the highway. This car has excellent visibility and handles really well on the road. It doesn't accelerate as quickly as I would like, but it's not bad for a four cylinder. I love how much legroom/headroom there is inside-and not just in the front, but as well as the backseat. The back seats fold flat creating a large cargo space, but even with the seats up there is plenty of cargo space. Easy to park, low maintenance cost, extra compartments, plenty of cupholders, the list just goes on. For such an affordable price, it has a lot to offer. The driver seat does not rise/lower which could be an issue for some drivers but the steering wheel can be adjusted. The speedometer/tachometer takes some getting used to as it is sideways-it took me a little while to adjust.

I drive 150 miles a day to/from work so I log a lot of miles quickly.  I am now up to 11,800 miles and have not had a problem.  It is comfortable and roomy for 4 adults.

The gas mileage is good and the seats are comfortable.Update: I've had my Scion for over 6 months now and I still love it! It is lively getting up to speed on the freeway and fun for urban driving.

They told me ""the bumper, grill and hood and vaious engine components crushed as designed, thereby absorbing and lowering much of the collisions forces.""

Both cars handle well, even at 60+ mph.  The Scion feels a little heavier, hence a little more solid. Both get great mileage.  The Scion has an Alpine radio and 6 speakers, the Honda 4 speakers. The Scion's rear seats area little more complex, because they offer extended rear legroom, which is unusual in a subcompact.  Enjoy the hatchback; kind of like a mini-SUV.

I was blown away at how much quieter the cabin was compared to the much larger (and pricier) Accord LX. Had always been a Honda fan, but the road noise is terrible, especially with a lot of ""chip seal"" roads that we have locally. The Scion was quiet, powerful and comfy with a long list of standard features. My biggest gripe was the dealer put a 2009 Pioneer stereo in the 2010 Scion, therefore, the USB/Aux jack didn't work.  Additionally, they didn't have the correct unit in stock when I got there. SO, another visit to the dealer is required.",4.875

I notice that when going over a man hole cover or any decent bumps in the road which we have a lot of here in NY's capital district. It's very jarring and annoying and makes me wonder if it is causing too much vibration to the chassis of the car causing premature wear. The other thing is that the cargo space even with the seats folded down is very limited compared to the fit and the Kia soul.

I like most everything about it.  The quality seems good.  It holds a lot of stuff with the back seats folded down.  The acceleration is surprisingly good, especially 0-30.  The interior is comfortable.  Handling is good; body lean is minimal when cornering.  The only downside to this car is the ride.  You don't feel the smallest bumps, but a somewhat bigger bump, like an expansion joint in pavement, is bone-jarring.  Riding around in this car for more than half an hour starts to get irritating.

I bought a standard transmission because, in my experience, these little engines don't do very well with automatic transmission's.

We live in the Sierra Foothills and go up and down 1,000 to 2,000 feet and that cuts into our mileage.  Our driving is probably 70% highway and 30% up and down.

Best features: (1) I was able to pack in a lot in such a small car; (2) It never burned oil; (3) It's a cute car; (4) Engine, trans, and clutch were problem-free for me.  Not-so-great features: (1) Repair costs (the previous owners probably didn't make any repairs and I ended up with the repair bills); (2) Paint on bumper and headlight covers were dulled by the time I owned it; (3) Cruise control would have been nice on our 3,000-mile trip last summer.",4

Had I driven it longer on the test drive, I might have had second thoughts; the ride is ultra firm.  One feels ever road imperfection and Michigan roads are very poor.  This car was marketed to youth, but I'm AARP material.  It should be a great grocery getter, but I don't think I'd like to take a long trip due to the harsh ride.  Perhaps softer tires would help?  I'll report back after I've logged more miles.",4.625
1220, on 06/17/09 17:45 PM (PDT),Balzo ,2005 Scion xA Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (1.5L 4cyl 5M),Not for long rides," Got the car brand new in '04 and used it mostly around town with the occasional 200 mile weekend trip. Great value for the money in terms of low purchase price and low operating cost. Power is what one might expect from a 108-hp motor but the 5-spd manual trans made the driving experience a bit more interesting. A 6th gear would be perfect for speeds over 70mph. Ride quality is bouncy on the interstate because of the short wheelbase and firm suspension but it's a blast around corners and when zipping around city traffic. 5 yrs and 50K miles later, I can say it was an overall positive experience. Would I buy a Scion again? Not likely. Just traded it in for a sporty euro sedan last week.",3.625

The Gas cap cover cable went the first year and Toyota had to replace something in the motor under the warranty but other than those two things this car has been worth every cent I paid for it.

Actually, I love my car so much that I convinced my mom to buy one (exact same color, too) when she totaled her Jeep.  This car gets terrific gas mileage, turns heads at every stop light, can zip in and out of traffic like a Mini, and is fun to drive.  I always wish for a little more power, but who could really ask for more with this set of features?  I put in my own stereo system, but even the standard MP3 setup impressed this stereo snob : ) .",5

I commute 44 mins one way and needed a reliable and economical car and the XA was everything I needed. The XA has power everything and the 5 speed manual does great on the hills. It's a comfortable ride and has the Toyota reliability emanating from it. It handles well on curves and is pretty quiet (I almost stalled it twice because I kept on thinking it was an automatic due to the quiet engine!). Plenty of room, where I can put 3 car seats in the back if I needed to. I like all the aftermarket parts I can put on it to make it personal. The only bad things is that it didn't have floor mats, cruise control, or armrest. ",5

I main reason I bought it is because it is a Toyota, and have experienced Toyota's reliabliliy. I needed a small, roomy, economical car and the Scion Xa fit the bill. Needless to say the price was right. I make regular trips to Lake Tahoe. I fill the car with my luggage and other items and have pulled all of the passes with no problem. It runs well at high altitudes. I have never experienced a reduction in horsepower or sluggish performance. I live in Southern California and it's peppy on the freeways.

Literally the worst car I've ever driven. Unreliable, cheaply made, and everything on it is special. Need a tire? There's only one tire that fits this car and it's ONLY made for this car. Be prepared to wait several days and pay double or triple what you expect.  Worse, they're those incredibly stupid 'low rolling resistance' tires, so there's no grip. They slide all over in the damp and you simply don't stop when pressing the brakes. In addition I'm certain there's a fault, either in design or construction, because I've been through 15 tires in two years! Make sure you don't let anything hit your windshield! Due to the sensors for the 'Smart City Brake' (which doesn't even work!) The sensors have to be recalibrated, another repair that costs twice as much because Toyota's designers are morons.This isn't just a bad design, it's actively dangerous. Those designers shouldn't be fired, they should be shot.",1
1269, on 05/12/18 19:33 PM (PDT),Dave W. ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6A),Transmission-related issues," Bought the Scion iA in 2016.  Loved it initially.  Seemed like a good value and gas mileage was great.  It’s a compact car so wasn’t expecting it to be full of luxury features.  However, now with less than 30,000 miles it had developed some sort of major transmission-related issue.  Intermittently, the car will not be drivable and/or experience some sort of loss of power which causes it to stall out or die in traffic.  I’m concerned that this issue will lead to a potential accident as I cannot predict when it will happen next.  We have taken it to Dan Wolf Toyota of Naperville (IL) and they say they cannot duplicate the problems.  Except, the fact that the car stalled while their porter was driving it, but they can’t duplicate the problem.  Therefore, they refuse to fix the car.  They’ve kept the car for 3 weeks on two occasions and still can’t pinpoint the problem.  The last time the car died, I had it towed to them costing me $160.   They say corporate will not allow them to replace the transmission for an intermittent problem.  Buyer beware!  Same car is now being sold under the Toyota brand calling it a Yaris iA.",1
1270, on 02/12/18 03:04 AM (PST),Kyle ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6A),Outstanding little car," I purchased this car in May of 2016 and currently have about 28000 Miles on it.  The IA is very dependable and gets amazing fuel economy for a non-hybrid. Currently I'm averaging 42-45mpg on mostly highway driving and driving conservatively. This number will go up to about 50 when the weather gets warmer. I love the little car, it can fit in small spaces, handles pretty well and saves a lot of money at the pump. The only drawbacks of the car are: no satellite radio, the factory tires are loud, have poor wet traction and already need replacing; they are also the only tire made in the factory size 185/60R16 so you'll have to go with a different size if you want a quality tire, and lastly the ride can sometimes be kind of harsh due to the short wheelbase. Overall it is a good car though and I plan on having it for many years to come.",5
1271, on 03/29/17 17:19 PM (PDT),Timothy I. Griffey ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6M),Reliable & Fuel Efficiant," Bought the car for my wife, to replace a 2000 Corolla with 300,000+ miles.  As a nurse my wife drives 100 miles a day.  Mileage was very important, as well as reliability.  Did not want a hybrid.  She has an affinity for manual shift cars, as was the Toyota Corolla this car was to replace.  After a year and almost 30,000 miles, we are very pleased.  I check the mileage every fill-up (religiously).  This car, with 6 speed manual shift, gets consistently 42 mpg.  Have been getting 39 to 40 around town.   No tire smoking power here, but reasonable performance esp with manual shift.  Great handling and smooth close shifting with standard trans.  Has a bit of a sporty ride that's more bumpy than my Camry.  Superb wet weather handling.  I was very impressed how well it tracked through puddles on rainy days.  It is well equipped for the price range.  Added the data card for GPS navigation for $400 dollars.  Received the nav card via mail in 2 weeks, with simple installation.  $400 might be a bit much for nav, but it beats having to buy a $1,500 package just to get it.  The Toyota brand has always been a home run for us.  We have owned several Toyotas and have put many trouble free miles on them.  So it's both Toyota and Mazda...  No problem here.  Great economical car for the price.",5

It handles nicely and sports mode gives it nice zip for 106 hp. Driving it to and from work is really enjoyable, for me this is the best part of the car. You also have the option to get great MPG depending on your driving. The trunk is surprisingly big and the build materials aregreat  for such a low priced car.  7 inch Navigation ( Got SD card for cheap off internet) is great also lots of hacks you can do to add Android auto or Apple car play (Just do a google search) .",5
1273, on 08/13/16 19:35 PM (PDT),Mario A. ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6A),It is a Mazda," Toyota did not make it. Toyota has a deal with Mazda to have Mazda make it in Mexico. That is why your VIN number has a M in it (Mexico).  Wanted Toyota Reliablity , hopefully Mazda builds reliable cars.  Do not know what kind of reliablity the IA has because it is a new model (in the US). Cannot find info on how reliable it is in other countries. Toyota now sells them as a Yaris IA. Tires are an oddball size so finding them is a chore. For an econobox it looks sporty. Great gas mileage. If you are concerned about the lack of power press the sport mode lever which is below the gearshift, but I am guessing that fuel economy will suffer.Update 2/19/17 it is a commuter car. 18000 miles and the tires show little wear. Changing the oil is not that bad, it is expensive if you take it to a shop because the engine requires synthetic oil. Happy so far.",5
1274, on 07/07/16 19:33 PM (PDT),Chris ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6M),Just what I wanted," Ok....so for the most part the car is great; fuel economy for me is 36mpg average and I drive in traffic to and from work (60 miles), I filled my tank for 15 bucks today which is amazing, technology is great and sound system is up to par, Bluetooth is great with no static when making calls or playing music, touch screen and reverse camera put the car at the top of the subcompact class, ample trunk and front seat space, low noise pollution from outaide the vehicle, and an overall well put together interior. I've put 2000 miles on the car and everything is a breeze thus far. BUT there has to be some bad right? Of course...the acceleration could be better and I find myself really pushing the car at times to get up to speed(I've been known to have a ""led foot"" and come from a car with a larger engine) , it might be me but the manual transmission, specifically first and second gear can be a little jumpy especially when trying to gain speed quickly(again may be a personal issue), there is a slight tick in the engine which makes me fear things to come but I will address it while under warranty, the tires and overall road grip could be better but are fine for someone who doesn't take turns hard (like me), the paint could be of better quality as I already have a little chip here and there, while there is plenty of room inside the car I could see how larger people would have trouble in the back seats, the touch screen can be dim and hard to see, and some materials in the interior are flimsy. PLEASE do not let these bad point sway you from even trying this car as I am really reaching to find problems...it's all around AMAZING. I have tried to justify any problems with the car as possibly a personal issue or maybe due to my own driving habits. If you're looking for something that is stylish, fuel efficient, reliable, and very affordable I would recommend this car hands down. I've done my research and had many test drives(Honda fit, Chevy cruze, sentra, versa, elantra, forte) but the moment I got in this car I was sold without a doubt in my mind. I could not give 5 stars because every car comes with its flaws but it's close.",4
1275, on 07/02/16 01:00 AM (PDT),Martin ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6A),Nice try. Really.," EPA sticker says 42 mpg open road. I get a good deal more. Long trips over 50 mpg. Seems the reason to buy the car. Initial impression is very high but fades quickly once you notice how ill fitting and how poorly mounted all the rubber seals and plastic shields fit. Like a child's toy.  Things you see the first time you hand wash it and not before.  A good amount of water drains from the doors after a wash. 3 or 4 more times normal.  Water even enters and exits around the mirror mounts at garden hose pressures. That's going to be a rust issue quickly. Engine compartment however seems quite water tight as does the trunk. The paint is nicely sprayed but is DEAD soft and easily chips and scratches with an impact of a medium sized bug.  We don't have 2K clears and ovens in Mexico? I have more chips and mars in this car in a month than my last five cars combine. ""Party"" metallic and dark colors does this cheap materials finishing no favors. Pure eye candy with no substance. There is so little clear on this car Perfect-it II is iffy.   Add in the special ""only tire"" available to suit the computers roll out and ""J"" flange alloy wheels which even the factory seems not to care about considering the inboard flange mounted wheel weights. Really, on a painted wheel? Why the tape weight in the visible area ONLY then? Corrosion is corrosion no matter which side of the wheel it's on.  At least the tires are not priced silly...if you can find one.    The nose is a love it or hate thing. I like it. As chrome is no longer really chrome I wish ""They"" would just monotone color trim and quite trying to pitch a dead horse. Real chrome or find another finish folks.  Pealing chrome looks worse that pitting. It lacks luster, depth and has zero protection. Not that it matters over PLASTIC.  At 6'' and 195 lbs. I challenge the interior space of compact cars and this one more than fits my frame. Even with the seat adjustment set to it highest level I have plenty of headroom, shoulder and leg room. The box around your knees could be more ample (Narrow the console or move the vertical line forward) but the seat will have you taking a break long before your knees feel cramped. Unpadded brick. Tilt/telo wheel is a nice touch and has good range. I don't ride in the back but I stuffed a 285 lb. salesman back there.  I bought this car after my third new Honda Civic and noting the hideous finishes and panel fits on the new 2016 Civics. Ops!!! Ergonomics are overall very good and not too busy. Controls well placed and make sense. I thought Sport mode would quicken the shift. Nope,  just lops off two gears and uselessly raises the sift point a few hundred rpm. Sounds faster, isn't.  I prefer the manual shift but would like paddles so my hands stay where my hands should be. Day time glare renders most instruments useless. What's that about? Ride is to lauded. For it's weight and wheelbase you would swear you were in a car with 10"" more reach and a thousand pounds more weight. Not plush mind you by not econobox buck board harsh either. Out rides cars a full segment higher.  Good handling. Steering is neutral to slightly tight and very pedal responsive to correction. Zoom-zoom. Very predictable turn in on very so-so tires and silly narrow rims. I'd like to comment on the brakes but the car is not brake limited. It's tire limited on the haul down. Brakes stop tires. Tires stop cars. Just say'n Toyota. The cruise control is NICE mated to this the Skyactiv 6 speed auto box with grade logic control that actually works and works GREAT. Now if the motor had enough  dynamic compression to actually brake the car on a 5-7% grade. For a motor of a pint and a half I'm impressed even of the community at large is not. Over a pound foot torque per cubic inch displacement is impressive normally aspirated. The AC will tax it and no matter how fast this car WILL go this isn't a 70 mph all day long car and expect any motor life from it. Yep a minus for every plus and if I were buy again....I'd buy a one year old Buick Verano for the same money and have twice the car at 60% the fuel economy and three times the comfort. Thing is. I bought it as a ""Econo run about"" to limit the miles on my LaCrosse and keep it indoors during the salty season. Sacrificial lamb of sorts that would be fun to drive. Oh and it is.",4
1276, on 06/30/16 12:19 PM (PDT),Andrew ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6A),Scion iA is a great car," The Scion iA far exceeds our expectations. For an extremely low purchase price, it came loaded, handles great, has great fuel economy and is loaded with safety features. We bought it for the kids to drive, we wanted them to have the safety features not available on a used car.  We added the navigation for $400 so the kids don't have to hold their phone to navigate.  The back seat is small but my son pointed out that there is plenty of room in the front and if his friends want a ride, they won't complain. I would have no problem if this were my primary vehicle. The only thing I would add is a center armrest. Mazda makes a great small car. The only think Toyota did to mess it up is add an ugly front end. This is not a super-powerful, super-fast super-stylish or super-big car, it is exactly what we were looking for: a small entry level car that is safe and enjoyable to drive.",5
1277, on 06/23/16 14:43 PM (PDT),Stephanie Junca ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6A),Love this little car!," I've had this 2016 Scion iA for a month now and driven 1,200 miles on it. I live in a heavily populated city and commute an hour to work so buying this car was just a given. I had driven other sub compact cars and this one handled the best with the best MPG. I drive around 300-400 miles a week and fill up every other week. Average MPG has been 38 for me. It is super easy to park also. That is a big plus for me since I have to parallel park everywhere and with the backup camera that comes standard it definitely helps. Another big plus on buying this car was the 2 year free maintenance package. My previous car I was taking it into the shop every few months for not only oil changes but a wide variety of issues even though it was only 4 years old when I sold it. So saving some cash in that area is awesome! All in all it is a great little car for the price! The only two drawbacks are these: acceleration is lagging when merging onto the highway but the sport feature definitely helps when I remember to push the button & the backseat area is very very tiny - tall people and this car will not go well together (luckily my boyfriend and I are on the shorter side so it works out). I do very much recommend this car to city dwellers, commuters and first time car buyers.",5

1279, on 06/16/16 08:54 AM (PDT),Michelle ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6A),Love it," I needed a new car bad, actually breaking down and dealing with car payments kind of searching. Very early on the last Saturday in August 2015, I had stopped at several dealerships. After thinking it was not working out and getting frustrated, I pulled into the Toyota's lot and took a look at what they had to offer. I tested drove this car twice, which I felt bad because those were the only miles put on the car. They allowed me to drive it until that next Monday. Anyways, it is now towards the end of June 2016 and I still love this car. Even those that I have let drive it. It handles great on the highway; love the sport mode switch. Going to the gas station, you don't have to cringe; I get just over 400 miles on a tank. This was a pocket book saver with working full time and being a full time student, work was 30 mins one direction and campus over an hour in the other. The display monitor, back up cam are among some of the nicest accessories to have and this is considered as standard feature. As for backseat comfort, as with any compact type cars, you can't have two extremely tall people sit in front of one another. Back seat comfort isn't bad at all. Plus the trunk space is huge for that car. I would recommend this to everyone I can.",5
1280, on 06/11/16 14:56 PM (PDT),Patrick ,2016 Scion iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6A),2016 Scion iA - great looking & riding sub compact," First off, be aware that Scion is no longer being made as of about April 2016 and that Toyota is absorbing the brand into the Toyota name so this is the last of the Scion's.   Fortunately the 2017 Toyota Yaris iA is the rebadged Scion iA so sourcing parts in the future shouldn't be an issue.  That said, the leg room for the driver was comfortable, driver foot pretty much straight rather than cocked over to the left and legs can comfortably lean against flat areas.   The automatic has a manual mode and ""sport"" mode for quicker acceleration.  It feels a bit laggy when accelerating but given it only has a 1.5cc engine it's to be expected and sport mode helps give it more zip.   Great cargo space though rear seat space is very tight which is fine for me as I wasn't anticipating having passengers often.  I like all the electronics it has.Features:   Remote entry with push button engine start / stop, 7"" screen with backup camera, optional GPS system (add $399 to price though negotiated it down to $199),  bluetooth connection to phone that shows text messages on screen, voice commands, electic locks / windows / mirrors.  Dash shows temperature, miles till empty, average mpg.  Sounds system pretty decent with knob select and volume control on both steering wheel and between seats.  Also has 2 USB connectors & accessory plug (cigarette lighter).  I keep a Samsung wireless fast charger in there that is velcro'd down so phone just sits on it to charge.   Pros:  I like both the interior & exterior styling, gas milage (up to 42mph on highway), bluetooth / phone / 7"" display / backup camera and handling.   Price seemed very competitive, got mine new for $15888 which included navigation chip and title / licensing.  Because no more Scion's are being made, should expect aggressive pricing to clear out 2016 inventory.Cons:  One reviewer said tires custom to Toyota dealer though haven't confirmed that.  The dash lights are not quite as bright for daylight driving as I'd like so have a hard time seeing information displayed (even after adjusting to full brightness) though at night time is great.  Rear deck lid I've found open multiple times due to button in pocket being pressed on inadvertently for 2 seconds or more though there may be a way of adjusting that (update: there was an option to make delay longer so no longer an issue).  Rear seat head rests at funky angle and not very comfortable according to my one passenger.Other:  No armrests though I don't like them anyways so not a con for me.  The 7"" display is permanently stuck up, probably for backup purposes and can be disabled at night if you don't want a glare.",5

I finally hit 5,000 miles and so far it has been such a great car. The only thing I didn't like at first was the acceleration (especially trying to enter highways), but that was easily fixed when I figured out how to use the ""sport"" mode!  I was actually impressed with driving this car in the winter because it snows heavily where I'm from, but thankfully I had no problems & I like that it warns you when your car is slipping. Definitely agree that the space in the back is very small! My friends are like salmons back there, but it the sound system & back camera make up for it. Lastly, the gas mileage is the best thing in the world. I fill up with $15-$20 ($20 when the light turns on). It has a range about 332 miles but I can go home (~300 miles) and still have a range of ~232 miles of gas. Would definitely recommend this car!!",5

I have had the car for about 3 months, it has 3800 miles, and I already have an issue with one of the tires.  The tires by the way are made specifically for the car, so you can only get them from the dealership.  I live in a major city and they only had ONE, yes ONE in the general area.  I plan on getting a tire for my trunk, instead of the just spare that comes with the car.  I travel a lot and I am now nervous about the  availability of the tire in some locations. The IA is  quiet on the road, and has a great sound system.  I LOVE the back up camera, works well when I need to parallel park or pulling out of tight and busy parking spaces.

I just bought mine four days ago and have already put 400 miles on it and only had to fill up once. The gas mileage is amazing which I get 48 on the hwy and is the main reason that I bought this car along with the Scion name and Toyota backing. I really enjoy the beautifully appointed interior with a pleasing and modern look. The outside gives the car a nice sporty vibe. The handling is great – I feel that the car sits firm on the road and takes bumps without any hesitation. The “info-tainment” center is something truly special. I love the entire connectivity of the car and back-up cam which all came standard and really added to the incentive of buying a sub-compact. What could be better? The acceleration leaves something to be desired – you don’t fly the way you expect in a small car like this. It takes a moment to get moving, but the drive itself is great. I’m still getting used to the very go-kart like gas pedal. The interior can feel a little cheap with all the plastic and the A/C knobs really need upgrading from 1991. No arm rest at all, which in hindsight seems like at least they could of added a fold down rest like a movie theater seat. There is no real backseat for other than hauling a family pet or some stuff, but people would feel cramped stuck back there for any length of time. I’m a commuter so I just don’t need the extra space.I’m very happy and proud to own the Scion iA. The beauty of this car is the bang for your buck and the look of a little racer. I don’t think it has an ugly face on the front, but that is just me. I would highly recommend going and test driving one. I will update my review when I hit 10,000 miles.",5

I watched many YouTube videos of the car being driven. I liked what I saw. I didn't care that people said the face looked like an Angry Bird. I love the way it looks. For the ""Pure Price"" it fit the bill for me in that I could avoid the pain of haggling with a salesman because I am so NOT a haggler. The car's size and all of the components that were all standard in this car attracted me. I have not driven 100 miles yet and I have yet to see the gas level move from full. The seats are very comfortable for me and the back seat felt as comfortable as the front. It handles well and it's great to park being smaller in size. Two things I don't like are the equality of the radio sound and the sometimes lagging acceleration but overall, I am happy with the 2016 Scion iA.I think it's a great first car, whether you are a teenager or a mature-ish person like me.",5
1288, on 11/10/16 11:07 AM (PST),Tbone ,2015 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),MY BABY!!," I love my 2013 IQ! I bought it used this summer 2016, 60,000 miles.  It looks brand new inside and out. I have always loved small cars and I had my eye on this model for some time.  I drive 40 miles to and from work, mostly highway miles.  My car handles great for me, has good pickup and acceleration.  My normal highway speed is about 73mph and it handles like any other car I've had.  It hasn't snowed yet but my car handles great in the rain so far.  My car needed new winter/all season tires so I went to tirerack.com and ordered them. Great price!  The one thing my car was missing was cruise control, it doesn't come standard.  I need cruise control because without it I will be going 80 or 60 without realizing it.  Made a call and took my car in to get cruise control added.  It cost $399.00 and is worth every penny.  My sister, who didn't want to get into my car, doesn't mind me driving at all now.  My husband and I are empty nesters now and the back seat  folded down is great for shopping or groceries.  My 4 tires fit in the back for me to take them to get put on.  I did change one other thing.  I have a white IQ and removed the standard hub caps.  My husband went online I think at hubcaps.com or something like that.  I got black shiny caps with a red trim and it looks like the real rim.  The hub caps are plastic and just snap on with a wire adjustment, cost about $35 for 4 caps, we bought 2 boxes in case one breaks.  Ignore all the skeptics.  My car handles great, rides great, is comfortable, my hubby likes to drive it, heater and A/C work so well I have to turn them off because it gets too hot or cold in a hurry, I can turn around on a two lane road with out stopping.  IQ is the Bomb,  I Love It.  Try it and you will too!!",5
1289, on 09/06/16 17:04 PM (PDT),Joseph ,2015 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),Best Micro Car Available! It's a Toyota!," UPDATE TO MY  ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:  Well, owning our 2015 Scion iQ only convinces my wife and I that purchasing this micro city vehicle was one of the best purchases we have ever made.  Everything we stated in our original review still holds true--even more so today.  Everyday, this vehicle proves it does exactly what it was designed to do.  We like our 2016 Prius, but when it comes to driving around the busy streets of Portland Oregon, we absolutely LOVE the iQ!  Best decision we made.  It will be with us for many years, and we are especially glad to have purchased Toyota's platinum extend warranty (eight years, 125,000 miles) due to the peace of mind we will have.  My wife is constantly telling me that she has never been so in love with a vehicle as she is with her ""Q"".  And believe me . . . we have owned dozens of new, very nice, and often times expensive vehicles over the years.  And who would have thought that the iQ would turn out to be the most enjoyable one of all them!My wife and I absolutely love the iQ. We are both 6 feet tall and find it a pleasure to enter and exit it. No more ""dropping"" into the seat or ""climbing"" out of it. And once inside, it is surprisingly open, spacious, and very comfortable. The iQ is an ingenious design and purposefully and built vehicle for getting around the city, as well as making shorter trips outside of the city (we know, because we do it quite often with no issues whatsoever). It is a high quality vehicle built by Toyota (quality and reliability). It is a very stable little car both in the city and on the highway. It is a joy to drive due to its' comfortable interior, high/upright seating position, great outward visibility, amazing agility and turning radius. Add to this the ability to park virtually anywhere and 40 mpg (we are averaging 42 mpg) and what more could one ask for in a micro car? Disregard the negative reviews from so-called ""professional"" automotive reviewers. They just don't ""get it"". They forget what the purpose of the iQ is all about. Rather . . . you should read all the great reviews by actual owners. This is the only way to get a true assessment of any vehicle--including the iQ. We purchased our 2015 iQ used, with approximately 6,000 miles on it. We love it so much that we purchased a Toyota Factory New Car Extended Warranty (eight years and 100,000 miles platinum warranty) because we intend on keeping it for many years.",5
1290, on 08/24/16 09:25 AM (PDT),Joseph ,2015 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),"Best Reliable, Premium Micro Car Available"," After almost a full year of researching and test driving  subcompact and micro cars, my wife and I purchased a used 2015 Scion iQ base model with 6,000 miles.  And we are happy to say that we could not be more pleased with our decision.  We were always intrigued by the concept of the Scion iQ, but felt it necessary to thoroughly look at the other subcompact and micro vehicles being offered by other manufacturers.  These included the Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit, Chevrolet Spark, Mini Cooper, Ford Fiesta and Focus, Nissan Versa Note, Mitsubishi Mirage, Fiat 500, and Smart for Two.  All of the before mentioned vehicles were eliminated for various reasons, including the reliability of each individual vehicle (with the exception of the Yaris and Fit) as well as the manufacturer’s overall reliability reputation.  In the end, the Scion iQ was the best small vehicle for us.I must state right up front that the iQ is not our only vehicle.  Regardless of how much we like it, we cannot say  that it would be our first choice if it were to be our only vehicle.  But as a second vehicle, to be used for running around town, and even limited distances away from town (up to 200 miles away), it is perfect!  When we need to carry a total of four passengers or more cargo, we then use our new 2016 Toyota Prius.So let me start by saying that both my wife and I are six feet tall, and find the front seating area in the iQ to be more than adequate for us.  There is plenty of leg room, and the seats are extremely comfortable without there being too much intrusion by the lower or upper bolsters.  One thing we both especially like is how easy it is to enter and exit the iQ.  The doors are large, and one does not have to “fall” into the seat because it is too low, nor does one have to “climb” out of it because it too low.  They are just right.  Outward visibility in all directions is good, although at first, the rather large pillars just behind the driver and passenger seemed to cause blind spots.  This quickly became a non-issue once we realized how to use the large side windows on both the driver’s and passenger’s side.  Also, the addition of two small convex mirrors helped.As far as the layout of the dash and instruments is concerned, everything is easily visible and well within reach.  We especially enjoy the three large easy to read and use climate controls (fan, mode, and temperature).  The speedometer and multi-function screen provide all the necessary information without being unnecessarily confusing.  The large Pioneer touch screen entertainment unit works flawlessly and provides excellent sound whether one is playing the radio, a CD, a USB, or speaking on their phone using the blue tooth feature.  Again, using all these features are simple and straightforward.I know Scion touts the fact that the iQ can accommodate up to four people, however it is either a very comfortable two-seater with a nice size cargo area, or a three seater with minimal cargo area.  And yes, it can easily sit a six foot adult in the front passenger seat while still accommodating a six foot adult in the back seat behind the passenger.  I do not think a six foot tall adult would want to spend more than a few hours in this back seat area but, it does work—and surprisingly so!As to how the iQ drives and handles . . . well, let us just say that it will surprise you.  The more time one spends driving this micro vehicle, the more they will appreciate it.  Honestly, it is the most fun one can have when negotiating crowded, busy city streets.  It accelerates and brakes just fine, and is able to dart in and out of traffic like a hummingbird.  The turning radius is unbelievable and smile inducing.   Merging onto and driving on freeways is like any other vehicle.  It is solid, stable, and smooth on all but the roughest of surfaces.  We fine no issues when cruising at 65 mph among semi-trucks, RV’ers, etc.  All this while averaging (at least for us) 44 mpg.  I cannot imagine anyone averaging less than the claimed 36/37 mpg unless they are racing the little iQ everywhere they go.  If one drives it gently, they should easily be able to approach or exceed 40 mpg.  Did we mention the incredibly small turning radius and parking ability of this car?The iQ does have its’ shortcomings, albeit a few of them are inherent in all micro vehicles.  First, the ride is obviously a little “choppy” when on rougher streets.  This takes a little getting used to, but really—it is not that bad.  And second, the engine and CVT transmission noise is noticeable.  Again, this is due to these components being so close to the occupants.  It should be noted we find almost no wind intrusion into the iQ, which makes listening to the audio system and speaking with other occupants a pleasant experience.  The other little things that could be improved would be the addition of a factory installed cruise control.  I realize Toyota’s reason for not offering it (even a",5

1292, on 01/14/18 14:53 PM (PST),Amazingrace83 ,2012 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),Baby speedster," Excellent for travel for 2 adults. Comfortable and roomy. I travel with my pitbull and my husband. Once this little baby hits the freeway it's free sailing. Not a super charged take off like a V6, but has some surprising get up and go if you need to hit the freeway quickly, climbs average for what you'd expect, but flying over 80 is a breeze! Maneuvering in between the larger vehicles and getting through traffic is easy. Made it to Laughlin from Surprise AZ and back on $12.  Don't be fooled, this little car is great if you're not looking for all the bells and whistles. I would describe it as a roll cage with airbags.  Never failed me yet. Cons:  NO spare tire, only a patch kit!?  Which is why I purchased Run Flat tires. Allows me up to 50 miles to the nearest place with a nail in my tire . . . unless I get a blow out from the side. Worth every penny. When the price of gas keeps going up and down, it cost me a max of $14 to fill up! Con:  Of course its going to have a small gas tank, but with the size of the car it is expected.  Built lightweight, you feel the road a little more when driving this car, and the steering is touchy, but easy to get used to. Very happy with this car and passing smog inspection was effortless!

1293, on 08/12/17 20:33 PM (PDT),Randy Johnson ,2012 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),2012 IQ will need $5K in engine work," All 2012 Scion IQ up to 2013 JTNJJXB0#DJ025093 were built with defective pistons. Unless a seller can prove they have had this work done, be prepared to spend $5K to have the piston replaced. See service bulletin S-SB-0032-13. Toyota may make a ""good will"" gesture of $1900 toward this repair. All of these cars should have been recalled. There's about 11,500 2012 - 2013 IQs involved. Outrageously dishonest  of Toyota.I tried to apply the $1900 ""good will"" gesture toward purchasing the parts (I am capable of installing them myself) but Toyota would not agree. Even Toyota's mechanic thought they should have recalled the 11,500 cars in question and tried to help me get the repairs paid for by Toyota. Finally, I had Toyota replace the pistons. Toyota did pay the $1900. I paid the remaining $2000+.  The car was using a quart of oil every 400 miles just before the repairs were made. Replacing the pistons corrected the problem.  However, shortly thereafter the catalytic converter failed (plugged up from the high oil consumption). I bought the catalytic converter and replaced that myself for about $400. It would have been $1000 if I let Toyota do it. All these parts (pistons, catalytic converter, etc) are proprietary. You can only buy them from Toyota. You are at their mercy. Now, 30,000 miles later, the car is running strong and getting 35 - 37 MPG. I still like the car. Three months after the Toyota repair a Toyota representative called me up and gave me a verbal spanking for not paying the entire amount and waiting for Toyota to reimburse me the $1900. The Service Department had agreed to the way we handled it. I told the woman I would NEVER BUY ANOTHER TOYOTA new or used and that I am having a good time spreading the word on their terrible customer policies. I had a sign shop make a professional sign for the back window stating ""Beware of 1,000's of Toyotas  with Defective Pistons, Google it."" I drive 100 miles a day in the Dallas, Metroplex. 1000's of people have seen that sign and dozens have asked me about it. I have all the paperwork and a nice picture of the car with the sign in front of their new headquarters building. You can see the picture on my FaceBook page. I guess after building that lavish new headquarters they can't stand the cost of standing behind their cars.  You should Google Toyota defective pistons and see what comes up. It wasn't  confined to just the Scion IQs. There are many, many more Toyota models with the problem.Review update 08-15-18: Car is running fine. Now at 171,000 miles, uses no oil. I still like the car but I will never buy another new or used Toyota because of the way I was treated. Five months after it was fixed a representative called me. They were not happy that the service manager allowed me to only pay the difference between the engine work cost and the $1900 ""good will"" gesture at the time the work was done. This made it easier for me to not come up with another $1900 and then have to wait to be reimbursed. I was shocked and it just reminded me how much I disliked how I was treated.  I spent $75 and had a sign shop make a nice full rear widow sign that said ""Beware of Toyotas with Defective Pistons."" You can see it on my FaceBook page setting in front of the new Dallas Toyota Headquarters. I drive 100 miles a day through Dallas everyday. I know thousands of people saw that sign and it makes me feel much better. Screw 'um!",4
1294, on 04/08/17 06:26 AM (PDT),Bob Moon ,2012 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),Smart vs Iq," I have had 3 Smarts before, I like small cars. I was motivated to buy an IQ because of the japanese techchnology. Havinga Smart is like having a Mercedes dressed as a Smart. Expensive repairs, it is a good car but when you come to service all you haved saved in gasoline goes down the drain. When I tested the IQ I could not beleived I was on a such a small car. The ride is far better than Smart cars. The confort, suspension, and better yet the IQ has 4 seats. Where I live in Puerto Rico a Smart will cost aroumd $20,000 and so the IQ. (With taxes, and all hidden costs). I know I dont have a racing car, so I dont expect a fast one. It  moves ok in stereets and in expressways, good ac and music. I am really pleased with my car. I sold my motorcycle to be on a safer ride. I am a Mustang 6cyl driver and I like to use my IQ a lot do to economy and parking space. I really recommend this one.",5
1295, on 03/29/17 00:23 AM (PDT),MtnRoad ,2012 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),Awesome car ---- I've owned it for a year now," I was in the market for one of these since the day I saw a dark purple one in a parking lot one day. I never knew the car existed. I had been overseas for a almost a decade and fell in love with these micro cars. They are pretty common in Japan where I have spent some time. There's a big following for micro cars there. The iQ does exactly what it's supposed to do. For starters, it has something like 12 airbags including the first rear one behind the rear passengers, and the safety rating is among the highest. It will seat four in a pinch, five actually if you're left with no choice and don't mind hearing the back seaters laugh and complain the whole time. Recommended seating is really 3+1 (the one being a small child if the drivers seat is set into a comfortable position). The front dash is cantilever with no glove box (they put the glove box under the front passenger seat) so the front passenger can slide up further if there's a third passenger.  Front leg room is still good and safe with plenty of room for a passenger in back. The front seat slid back to a comfortable position kind of prevents a full size passenger behind...but it does have four seats and that's 2x more than the Smart Car.  PERFORMANCE: I have zero complaints. This car wants to go 80-85 down the freeway if I'm not careful, and still has plenty of power. It really wants to go. I haven't done it, but I think this car would easily break 100+ mph. In stop and go traffic this car is peppy and will give you no trouble getting to speed. The CVT automatic transmission is awesome. It does have a more powerful gear but I rarely have used that. The engine is a 1.3L and is probably too big in my honest opinion. 99 percent of the time I drive alone and without cargo so they could have just given the US market the same 1.0L they use in Europe. That 1.0L gets 60mpg!!! If sold in the US market, a 1.0L. It would have made this the most popular car in the country. But, since thew MSRP was only around $16,000 I think they knew it would have killed sales for the Corolla and Prius which is 2x that price.  HANDLING: The iQ has traction control, and really quiet electronic power steering.  The tires are wide so you don't tossed around on uneven roads  CARGO: The split rear seats fold down individually. There is quite a bit of room, but be advised there is no room behind those seats when they're up. There is a hidden compartment back there to hide a small items. I drive my car with both back seats down. The floor space in the cargo area will hold a grocery cart full of groceries in one layer. You could easuly fit two or three carts full but they'd be stacked. I have put medium sized boxes back there. Large boxes have to go in the front passenger seat. There's plenty of room for a large box but you can't get it through the hatchback door. Headroom and front seating is comfortable. I have never sat in back but it doesn't look too bad back there.  Excellent visibility all around out the windows. There are two cup holders in back, one in the middle front, and one in each door. ACCESSORIES: The AC is quiet and blows cold. Heat works just a good. My stereo is the base model so I don't have navigation. It works great, sounds awesome, and the hands free controls on the steering wheel are nice. Even the base model stereo has the hands free option for cell phones. The mic is up near the speedo. The window motors are fast and strong. power mirrors are nice. Only one airplane style overhead omni-directional interior lamp. There are accessory, MP3, and USB outlets. EXTERIOR: Paint is good. I live in Arizona and the sun beats cars up here but the paint is holding up well (I have the silver color). The car has an aggressive look in the front with the swept back headlights. PROS: This car is fun to drive, peppy, and has no trouble going up the freeway ramp. A lot of people love it. If you're worried about how you'll look driving this, be advised this is not a Smart Car or some other lame looking micro car. This car is pretty stout looking. Toyota Service Dept is honest and fair, no probs w/ my Platinum Warranty. CONS: Rarely do I get the advertised 37mpg. I log my miles and calculate at fill ups and I average about 35. I try to watch my speed and I don't race around either. Recent trip to San Diego at normal speed was the same. That is disappointing. Tire size is expensive ($150 ea). No spare tire.  Stay alert because lazy drivers that only use mirrors to change lanes might not see you. I've had a few ppl change lanes into me and almost cause a crash. I use a dash cam everywhere I go.",4
1296, on 08/12/16 13:17 PM (PDT),Like A Rock ,2012 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),Impulse buy. I'm very happy with it.," UPDATE 12 FEB 2018 -- I sold my iQ. I miss it. I bought a pre-owned Toyota Yaris for more backseat and cargo room. Yaris is great but not as refined. The iQ was solid, mostly quiet. Cost of ownership and tires for a Yaris is less. // OLD iQ REVIEW: I bought a pre-owned base model, silver color. The base model still comes nicely equipped with stability and traction control, pw. pdl, great ac, great stereo and speakers, 1 usb, 1 aux, and 1 power port. My base model has hubcaps but I like the way they look over the alloy wheels I've seen on other IQ's. There are pros and cons about this car so I will start with the pros:  It is one of the safest cars on the road, has 11 airbags, and drives and handles great. Steering is quick and precise, and it can turn around in a very small space making easy driving in traffic or lots. I don't have any trouble getting to speed on highway on-ramps, or passing vehicles when I need to. The engine is a 1.3L which is plenty big. I'm not going to knock other cars in this class because I have not driven them, but one car that's in the same class, but only has two seats, is sporting an engine almost half the size of the IQ, basically motorcycle size, and I don't think that's viable option for a long term vehicle. The 1.3L engine size has been commonly used around the World and has no issues. I actually belong to a Ford Festiva club in my area and those were made with 1.3L engines back in the 80s and 90s that were less refined than the Toyota IQ engine, and anyone that knows about Festivas they are one of the best basic utility cars ever made and many are still on the road today running like champs (including mine); some with 300k plus on the odo.  The Scion IQ doesn't fall short in performance in my opinion. You won't be winning any races up the freeway ramp against bigger engine sports cars but it performs very well and will get you to proper speed...and don't worry nobody is going to blow your doors off it can make those other drivers sweat while they try to pass you. On the highway it doesn't want to cruise 55mph...it wants to go 85mph smooth and quiet so watch your speed it has plenty of juice. The automatic CVT transmission performs great, revs low, is easy to use, and has a power option for climbing steep roads. In town it also drives great and gets a lot of attention. They are not that common and people tend to gather around them when parked. The interior is designed cool, and controls are easy to use. The computer readout on the left side of the dash can give the driver all sorts of data including average mileage, a couple of trip odometers,  eco on, clock, etc.  Gas mileage for me has been better than the advertised 37 hwy and 37 city. I reset my trip odometer at every fill up and calculate my mileage mostly for fun, and in many cases I get a little over 40mpg which is a mix of city and city freeway. The CVT mentioned earlier is what makes this car perform so well. The one time I got less than 37mpg was a road trip to San Diego in which I drove a steady 75-80mph, steep hills, ac on, and averaged about 33mpg...still not bad. Cargo room is okay considering the size and length of this car. I mostly drive alone in it and just keep the backseats folded down to pick up packages, groceries, etc. The backseats are divided so you can fold one down if you have cargo and a back seat passenger.  The car is really made for 3 adults, and one small child or cargo. The front dash on the interior is offset to allow the front passenger to sit forward a little more if needed so an adult can ride in back. I have seen video reviews of 4 adults in the car, and actually you could get a total of 5 in the car, but it's really a 3+1 car to be comfortable. Still, it's one of the smallest and best made (Toyota ) 4 seat cars in the World.  ---- Cons: I really have no complaints, but here are a few cons to consider. Cargo room is limited if you haul large items other than mail packages and groceries. It doesn't have a spare tire, but it does have the commonly used electric air pump that plugs in the dash and the slime to pump into the tire. I have not used this on my car but did help a lady in a new model Hyundai who had a flat and it worked fine and got air back in her tire so she could seek out a tire repair or purchase. I honestly prefer to have a spare tire though.  The tires are wide and perform very well, but it's an odd size P175/60R16 that only a couple manufacturers make (Goodyear is the recommended tire). The cost is about $153 each at the time I wrote this.  Lastly, idiot drivers on the road that only use mirrors to change lanes might not see you. On one occasion I’ve had someone change lanes into my lane at night right next to me. They just don’t see you in their mirror because of the length. --- Overall, I love this car and I’m glad I bought it. The Toyota quality also gives me confidence in it. So far I’ve had one routine maintenance service at the Toyota dealer and it was fast and cheap.",4
1297, on 07/25/16 10:48 AM (PDT),Fearless Freddie ,2012 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),Just what I needed!," Remember it is a very small car, good for 2 people and use the back seat area for shopping bags.  You get Toyota reliability and an automatic that reminds me of the very old Dynaflow.  It is easy to drive and provides a smooth ride on good roads and  a transmission  that is shiftlessly smooth.  When two people are in the car you will think it is full sized.  Quality is good and what ever you do, don't look for the transmission dipstick!  Why?   It is nonexistent.  The transmission is sealed and supposedly good for 120,000 miles.  Basically don't worry about it, forever!  There is a dipstick for engine oil.  Use 0 W 20 weight.  Good radio!  This is your chance to go green and save us all from global warming.  By the way the car has been discontinued by Toyota so their are bargains out there on the used car market for a great little city car.  I did take it out on the expressway and it did nicely at 65 mph.  I suggest driving with 2 hands on the steering wheel! Enjoy and adjust if you buy one. I does give a rough ride on rough roads!  It was a great car.  I traded it for a 1948 Crosley, a 50 mpg economy car that was way ahead of its time.",5

A simple lane change required lots of mirror checking and head movement.I had the Scion Red rear stabilizer bar installed by the dealer. This part took about a week to arrived/be installed, so I had a chance to do a before/after comparison.The stabilizer bar is worth every penny it cost IMHO.

I paid $17K including taxes and fees. While it might seem expensive to some, think of it as buying a premium little car with Toyota reliability and Scion style. With the passenger seat pushed forward you can accommodate a 3rd adult passenger in the back seat, but it is in essence a comfortable 2 seater. With the 50/50 split rear seats down the cargo volume is significantly increased. The exterior is stylish and striking, and thanks to my Hot Lava paint job I'm turning heads. This is the most fun I have ever had owning a vehicle. If you're looking for a fun, fuel efficient, reliable, stylish, premium 2 seater, then the iQ is for you.",4.875

But was amazed at just how roomy it really is! Very easy to get in and out of and the front seats adjust nicely.

I am a tad hesitant to take it on the major freeways but have done it, just more of a side street gal!

1318, on 02/28/16 09:52 AM (PST),QA ,2013 Scion iQ Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.3L 4cyl CVT),Micro Car Macro Ride!, The car critics are too judgmental and people who expect an SUV in an 120 inch long car are not being fair or realistic. This car drives great and I have had lots of BMW's Mercedes and Porches and Japanese cars. the CVT transmission works perfectly and is smooth and quiet. Acceleration is more than adequate for freeway and passing. In town the car is in it's element. It accelerates fast if necessary but half throttle is all that is needed. Stopping is smooth and sure with the front discs brakes. The radio is is only soft spot but that is a minor thing. this car is designed to get you around an urban environment and enable you to park where the smallest spot exists. It succeeds in fabulous style. Inside the car looks and feels like a big car. Loosen the backseat head rests and the seat backs fold down giving tons of cargo space. You can put a 6 footer in the front passenger and another in the right back seat without touching knees but the left back seat leg room is shorter. Big deal since you didn't buy it to carry four people ... but you can easily. The mileage is going to be lower than the 36/37 but it is always lower than the government ratings. Mileage runs in the low 30's depending on how much air is in the tires. Again there is no surprise there. You can get really high mileage but it depends on how you want to drive the car. The car looks great and people remark about it all the time. The stock wheels are some sporty alloys and the car looks fantastic. I am really pleased so far.,5

I looked on Google and found others with the same complaint. 27MPG and a tiny car? It kinda makes the whole concept silly. I returned the car with 100 miles and was very angry. I got a Prius C instead.The back seats touch the front seats, having NO place to put your feet/legs. You cannot fold the backseats with out removing the headrests and leaving them home. I don't understand why it even has backseats. Maybe so they can Claim it can carry 4?There is no luggage room, again you need to fold backseats to have storage room. I suggest removing them out of the car completely as they have zero function.",3

The whole idea about this car is being small. People like me want a tiny car to zip around. Only problem is that the car doesn't zip very much. And for a tiny car the fuel economy is not much better than my Mazda CX-5 SUV. The engine sounds like there are loose marbles inside at startup, and also makes other uninspiring noises from time to time. The brake pedal makes loud annoying clicking noise (normal noise, according to Toyota). It doesn't offer a lot of features for the money. The only good thing about it is the tiny size.",3.375
